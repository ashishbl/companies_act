 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <em>(This Accounting Standard includes paragraphs set in <strong>bold
 italic</strong> type and plain type, which have equal authority.
 Paragraphs in bold italic type indicate the main principles. This
 Accounting Standard should be read in the context of its objective and
 the General Instructions contained in part A of the Annexure to the
 Notification.)</em></p>
 <p> &nbsp;<br>
 <strong>Objective</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> A primary issue in accounting for inventories is the determination
 of the value at which inventories are carried in the financial
 statements until the related revenues are recognised. This Standard
 deals with the determination of such value, including the ascertainment
 of cost of inventories and any write-down thereof to net realisable
 value.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;<br>
 <strong>Scope</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 20pt;"> <strong><em>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>This
 Standard should be applied in accounting for inventories other than: </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> <strong><em>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>work
 in progress arising under construction contracts, including directly
 related service contracts (see Accounting Standard (AS) 7, Construction
 Contracts); </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> <strong><em>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>work
 in progress arising in the ordinary course of business of service
 providers; </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> <strong><em>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>shares,
 debentures and other financial instruments held as stock-in-trade; and </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> <strong><em>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>producers'
 inventories of livestock, agricultural and forest products, and mineral
 oils, ores and gases to the extent that they are measured at net
 realisable value in accordance with well-established practices in those
 industries.</em></strong></p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> &nbsp;</p>
 </div>
 <div style="font-family: Arial;">
 <p> 2. The inventories referred to in paragraph 1 (d) are measured at
 net realisable value at certain stages of production. This occurs, for
 example, when agricultural crops have been harvested or mineral oils,
 ores and gases have been extracted and sale is assured under a forward
 contract or a government guarantee, or when a homogenous market exists
 and there is a negligible risk of failure to sell. These inventories
 are excluded from the scope of this Standard.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Definitions</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 20pt;"> <strong><em>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>The
 following terms are used in this Standard with the meanings specified: </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> <strong><em>3.1&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em><u>Inventories</u></em></strong><strong><em>
 are assets: </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 62pt;"> <strong><em>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>held
 for sale in the ordinary course of business; </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 62pt;"> <strong><em>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>in
 the process of production for such sale; or </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 62pt;"> <strong><em>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>in
 the form of materials or supplies to be consumed in the production
 process or in the rendering of services. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> <strong><em>3.2&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em><u>Net
 realisable value</u></em></strong><strong><em> is the estimated selling
 price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of
 completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inventories encompass goods purchased
 and held for resale, for example, merchandise purchased by a retailer
 and held for resale, computer software held for resale, or land and
 other property held for resale. Inventories also encompass finished
 goods produced, or work in progress being produced, by the enterprise
 and include materials, maintenance supplies, consumables and loose
 tools awaiting use in the production process. Inventories do not
 include spare parts, servicing equipment and standby equipment which
 meet the definition of property, plant and equipment as per AS 10, <em>Property,
 Plant and Equipment</em>. Such items are accounted for in accordance
 with Accounting Standard (AS) 10, <em>Property, Plant and Equipment</em>.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Measurement of Inventories</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 20pt;"> <strong><em>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>Inventories
 should be valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;<strong>Cost of Inventories</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>6. The cost of inventories should comprise all costs
 of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing
 the inventories to their present location and condition.</em></strong></p>
 <p> <strong>Costs of Purchase</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 7. The costs of purchase consist of the purchase price including
 duties and taxes (other than those subsequently recoverable by the
 enterprise from the taxing authorities), freight inwards and other
 expenditure directly attributable to the acquisition. Trade discounts,
 rebates, duty drawbacks and other similar items are deducted in
 determining the costs of purchase.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;<strong>Costs of Conversion</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The costs of conversion of inventories
 include costs directly related to the units of production, such as
 direct labour. They also include a systematic allocation of fixed and
 variable production overheads that are incurred in converting materials
 into finished goods. Fixed production overheads are those indirect
 costs of production that remain relatively constant regardless of the
 volume of production, such as depreciation and maintenance of factory
 buildings and the cost of factory management and administration.
 Variable production overheads are those indirect costs of production
 that vary directly, or nearly directly, with the volume of production,
 such as indirect materials and indirect labour.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The allocation of fixed production
 overheads for the purpose of their inclusion in the costs of conversion
 is based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. Normal
 capacity is the production expected to be achieved on an average over a
 number of periods or seasons under normal circumstances, taking into
 account the loss of capacity resulting from planned maintenance. The
 actual level of production may be used if it approximates normal
 capacity. The amount of fixed production overheads allocated to each
 unit of production is not increased as a consequence of low production
 or idle plant. Un allocated overheads are recognised as an expense in
 the period in which they are incurred. In periods of abnormally high
 production, the amount of fixed production overheads allocated to each
 unit of production is decreased so that inventories are not measured
 above cost. Variable production overheads are assigned to each unit of
 production on the basis of the actual use of the production facilities.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 10.&nbsp; A production process may result in more than one product
 being produced simultaneously. This is the case, for example, when
 joint products are produced or when there is a main product and a
 by-product. When the costs of conversion of each product are not
 separately identifiable, they are allocated between the products on a
 rational and consistent basis. The allocation may be based, for
 example, on the relative sales value of each product either at the
 stage in the production process when the products become separately
 identifiable, or at the completion of production. Most by-products as
 well as scrap or waste materials, by their nature, are immaterial. When
 this is the case, they are often measured at net realisable value and
 this value is deducted from the cost of the main product. As a result,
 the carrying amount of the main product is not materially different
 from its cost.</p>
 </div>
 <div style="font-family: Arial;">
 <p> <strong>Other Costs</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 11.&nbsp; Other costs are included in the cost of inventories only
 to the extent that they are incurred in bringing the inventories to
 their present location and condition. For example, it may be
 appropriate to include overheads other than production overheads or the
 costs of designing products for specific customers in the cost of
 inventories.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 12.&nbsp; Interest and other borrowing costs are usually considered
 as not relating to bringing the inventories to their present location
 and condition and are, therefore, usually not included in the cost of
 inventories.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;<strong>Exclusions from the Cost of Inventories</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 13. In determining the cost of inventories in accordance with
 paragraph 6, it is appropriate to exclude certain costs and recognise
 them as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. Examples of
 such costs are:</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> (a)&nbsp; abnormal amounts of wasted materials, labour, or other
 production costs;</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> (b)&nbsp; storage costs, unless those costs are necessary in the
 production process prior to a further production stage;</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> (c)&nbsp; administrative overheads that
 do not contribute to bringing the inventories to their present location
 and condition; and</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> (d)&nbsp; selling and distribution costs.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;<br>
 <strong>Cost Formulas</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>14.&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>The cost of
 inventories of items that are not ordinarily interchangeable and goods
 or services produced and segregated for specific projects should be
 assigned by specific identification of their individual costs. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 15.&nbsp; Specific identification of cost means that specific costs
 are attributed to identified items of inventory. This is an appropriate
 treatment for items that are segregated for a specific project,
 regardless of whether they have been purchased or produced. However,
 when there are large numbers of items of inventory which are ordinarily
 interchangeable, specific identification of costs is inappropriate
 since, in such circumstances, an enterprise could obtain predetermined
 effects on the net profit or loss for the period by selecting a
 particular method of ascertaining the items that remain in inventories.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>16.&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>The cost of
 inventories, other than those dealt with in paragraph 14, should be
 assigned by using the first-in, first-out (FIFO), or weighted average
 cost formula. The formula used should reflect the fairest possible
 approximation to the cost incurred in bringing the items of inventory
 to their present location and condition. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 17.&nbsp; A variety of cost formulas is used to determine the cost
 of inventories other than those for which specific identification of
 individual costs is appropriate. The formula used in determining the
 cost of an item of inventory needs to be selected with a view to
 providing the fairest possible approximation to the cost incurred in
 bringing the item to its present location and condition. The FIFO
 formula assumes that the items of inventory which were purchased or
 produced first are consumed or sold first, and consequently the items
 remaining in inventory at the end of the period are those most recently
 purchased or produced. Under the weighted average cost formula, the
 cost of each item is determined from the weighted average of the cost
 of similar items at the beginning of a period and the cost of similar
 items purchased or produced during the period. The average may be
 calculated on a periodic basis, or as each additional shipment is
 received, depending upon the circumstances of the enterprise.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;<br>
 <strong>Techniques for the Measurement of Cost</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 18.&nbsp; Techniques for the measurement of the cost of
 inventories, such as the standard cost method or the retail method, may
 be used for convenience if the results approximate the actual cost.
 Standard costs take into account normal levels of consumption of
 materials and supplies, labour, efficiency and capacity utilisation.
 They are regularly reviewed and, if necessary, revised in the light of
 current conditions.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 19.&nbsp; The retail method is often used in the retail trade for
 measuring inventories of large numbers of rapidly changing items that
 have similar margins and for which it is impracticable to use other
 costing methods. The cost of the inventory is determined by reducing
 from the sales value of the inventory the appropriate percentage gross
 margin. The percentage used takes into consideration inventory which
 has been marked down to below its original selling price. An average
 percentage for each retail department is often used.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;<br>
 <strong>Net Realisable Value</strong></p>
 <p> 20. The cost of inventories may not be recoverable if those
 inventories are damaged, if they have become wholly or partially
 obsolete, or if their selling prices have declined. The cost of
 inventories may also not be recoverable if the estimated costs of
 completion or the estimated costs necessary to make the sale have
 increased. The practice of writing down inventories below cost to net
 realisable value is consistent with the view that assets should not be
 carried in excess of amounts expected to be realised from their sale or
 use.</p>
 </div>
 <p style="font-family: Arial;"> &nbsp;</p>
 <div style="font-family: Arial;">
 <p> 21.&nbsp; Inventories are usually written down to net realisable
 value on an item-by-item basis. In some circumstances, however, it may
 be appropriate to group similar or related items. This may be the case
 with items of inventory relating to the same product line that have
 similar purposes or end uses and are produced and marketed in the same
 geographical area and cannot be practicably evaluated separately from
 other items in that product line. It is not appropriate to write down
 inventories based on a classification of inventory, for example,
 finished goods, or all the inventories in a particular business segment.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 22.&nbsp; Estimates of net realisable value are based on the most
 reliable evidence available at the time the estimates are made as to
 the amount the inventories are expected to realise. These estimates
 take into consideration fluctuations of price or cost directly relating
 to events occurring after the balance sheet date to the extent that
 such events confirm the conditions existing at the balance sheet date.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 23.&nbsp; Estimates of net realisable value also take into
 consideration the purpose for which the inventory is held. For example,
 the net realisable value of the quantity of inventory held to satisfy
 firm sales or service contracts is based on the contract price. If the
 sales contracts are for less than the inventory quantities held, the
 net realisable value of the excess inventory is based on general
 selling prices. Contingent losses on firm sales contracts in excess of
 inventory quantities held and contingent losses on firm purchase
 contracts are dealt with in accordance with the principles enunciated
 in Accounting Standard (AS) 4, Contingencies and Events Occurring After
 the Balance Sheet Date.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 24.&nbsp; Materials and other supplies held for use in the
 production of inventories are not written down below cost if the
 finished products in which they will be incorporated are expected to be
 sold at or above cost. However, when there has been a decline in the
 price of materials and it is estimated that the cost of the finished
 products will exceed net realisable value, the materials are written
 down to net realisable value. In such circumstances, the replacement
 cost of the materials may be the best available measure of their net
 realisable value.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 20pt;"> 25.&nbsp;&nbsp; An assessment is made of
 net realisable value as at each balance sheet date.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Disclosure</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 20pt;"> <strong><em>26.&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>The
 financial&nbsp; statements should disclose: </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> <strong><em>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>the

 cost formula used; and </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> <strong><em>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>the
 total carrying amount of inventories and its classification appropriate
 to the enterprise. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 27.&nbsp; Information about the carrying amounts held in different
 classifications of inventories and the extent of the changes in these
 assets is useful to financial statement users. Common classifications
 of inventories are:</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 29pt;"> (a) Raw materials and components</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 29pt;"> (b) Work-in-progress</p>

 <p> <strong>Introduction</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 20pt;"> 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Standard
 deals with the treatment in financial statements of</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 43pt;"> (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 contingencies, and</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 43pt;"> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; events
 occurring after the balance sheet date.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <sup>*</sup>All paragraphs of this Standard that deal with
 contingencies are applicable only to the extent not covered by other
 Accounting Standards prescribed by the Central Government. For example,
 the impairment of financial assets such as impairment of receivables
 (commonly known as provision for bad and doubtful debts) is governed by
 this Standard. </div>
 <div style="font-family: Arial;">
 <p> 2. The following subjects, which may result in contingencies, are
 excluded from the scope of this Standard in view of special
 considerations applicable to them:</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> (a)&nbsp;&nbsp; liabilities of life
 assurance and general insurance enterprises arising from policies

 <p> <strong>Definitions</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 20pt;"> <strong><em>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>The
 following terms are used in this Standard with the meanings specified: </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>3.1&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>A contingency is
 a condition or situation, the ultimate outcome of which, gain or loss,
 will be known or determined only on the occurrence, or non-occurrence,
 of one or more uncertain future events. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>3.2&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>Events occurring
 after the balance sheet date are those significant events, both
 favourable and unfavourable, that occur between the balance sheet date
 and the date on which the financial statements are approved by the
 Board of Directors in the case of a company, and, by the corresponding
 approving authority in the case of any other entity. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 20pt;"> <strong><em>Two types of events can be
 identified:</em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>(a)&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>those which
 provide further evidence of conditions that existed at the balance
 sheet date; and </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>(b) </em></strong><strong><em>those which are
 indicative of conditions that arose subsequent to the balance sheet
 date. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Explanation</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 20pt;"> <strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Contingencies
 </strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 4.1&nbsp; The term "contingencies" used in this Standard is
 restricted to conditions or situations at the balance sheet date, the
 financial effect of which is to be determined by future events which
 may or may not occur.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 4.2&nbsp; Estimates are required for determining the amounts to be
 stated in the financial statements for many on-going and recurring
 activities of an enterprise. One must, however, distinguish between an
 event which is certain and one which is uncertain. The fact that an
 estimate is involved does not, of itself, create the type of
 uncertainty which characterises a contingency. For example, the fact
 that estimates of useful life are used to determine depreciation, does
 not make depreciation a contingency; the eventual expiry of the useful
 life of the asset is not uncertain. Also, amounts owed for services
 received are not contingencies as defined in paragraph 3.1, even though
 the amounts may have been estimated, as there is nothing uncertain
 about the fact that these obligations have been incurred.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 4.3&nbsp; The uncertainty relating to future events can be
 expressed by a range of outcomes. This range may be presented as
 quantified probabilities, but in most circumstances, this suggests a
 level of precision that is not supported by the available information.
 The possible outcomes can, therefore, usually be generally described
 except where reasonable quantification is practicable.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 4.4&nbsp;&nbsp; The estimates of the outcome and of the financial
 effect of contingencies are determined by the judgement of the
 management of the enterprise. This judgement is based on consideration
 of information available up to the date on which the financial
 statements are approved and will include a review of events occurring
 after the balance sheet date, supplemented by experience of similar
 transactions and, in some cases, reports from independent experts.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 20pt;"> <strong><em>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>Accounting
 Treatment of Contingent Losses </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 5.1&nbsp; The accounting treatment of a contingent loss is
 determined by the expected outcome of the contingency. If it is likely
 that a contingency will result in a loss to the enterprise, then it is
 prudent to provide for that loss in the financial statements.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 5.2&nbsp; The estimation of the amount of a contingent loss to be
 provided for in the financial statements may be based on information
 referred to in paragraph 4.4.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 5.3&nbsp; If there is conflicting or insufficient evidence for
 estimating the amount of a contingent loss, then disclosure is made of
 the existence and nature of the contingency.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 5.4&nbsp; A potential loss to an enterprise may be reduced or
 avoided because a contingent liability is matched by a related
 counter-claim or claim against a third party. In such cases, the amount
 of the provision is determined after taking into account the probable
 recovery under the claim if no significant uncertainty as to its
 measurability or collectability exists. Suitable disclosure regarding
 the nature and gross amount of the contingent liability is also made.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 5.5&nbsp; The existence and amount of guarantees, obligations
 arising from discounted bills of exchange and similar obligations
 undertaken by an enterprise are generally disclosed in financial
 statements by way of note, even though the possibility that a loss to
 the enterprise will occur, is remote.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 5.6&nbsp; Provisions for contingencies are not made in respect of
 general or unspecified business risks since they do not relate to
 conditions or situations existing at the balance sheet date.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 20pt;"> <strong><em>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>Accounting
 Treatment of Contingent Gains </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 20pt;"> Contingent gains are not recognised in
 financial statements since their recognition may result in the
 recognition of revenue which may never be realised. However, when the
 realisation of a gain is virtually certain, then such gain is not a
 contingency and accounting for the gain is appropriate.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 20pt;"> <strong><em>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>Determination
 of the Amounts at which Contingencies are included in Financial
 Statements </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 7.1&nbsp; The amount at which a contingency is stated in the
 financial statements is based on the information which is available at
 the date on which the financial statements are approved. Events
 occurring after the balance sheet date that indicate that an asset may
 have been impaired, or that a liability may have existed, at the
 balance sheet date are, therefore, taken into account in identifying
 contingencies and in determining the amounts at which such
 contingencies are included in financial statements.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 7.2&nbsp; In some cases, each contingency can be separately
 identified, and the special circumstances of each situation considered
 in the determination of the amount of the contingency. A substantial
 legal claim against the enterprise may represent such a contingency.
 Among the factors taken into account by management in evaluating such a
 contingency are the progress of the claim at the date on which the
 financial statements are approved, the opinions, wherever necessary, of
 legal experts or other advisers, the experience of the enterprise in
 similar cases and the experience of other enterprises in similar
 situations.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 7.3 If the uncertainties which created a contingency in respect of
 an individual transaction are common to a large number of similar
 transactions, then the amount of the contingency need not be
 individually determined, but may be based on the group of similar
 transactions. An example of such contingencies may be the estimated
 uncollectable portion of accounts receivable. Another example of such
 contingencies may be the warranties for products sold. These costs are
 usually incurred frequently and experience provides a means by which
 the amount of the liability or loss can be estimated with reasonable
 precision although the particular transactions that may result in a
 liability or a loss are not identified. Provision for these costs
 results in their recognition in the same accounting period in which the
 related transactions took place.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 20pt;"> <strong><em>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>Events
 Occurring after the Balance Sheet Date </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 8.1&nbsp; Events which occur between the balance sheet date and the
 date on which the financial statements are approved, may indicate the
 need for adjustments to assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet
 date or may require disclosure.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 8.2&nbsp; Adjustments to assets and liabilities are required for
 events occurring after the balance sheet date that provide additional
 information materially affecting the determination of the amounts
 relating to conditions existing at the balance sheet date. For example,
 an adjustment may be made for a loss on a trade receivable account
 which is confirmed by the insolvency of a customer which occurs after
 the balance sheet date.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 8.3&nbsp; Adjustments to assets and liabilities are not appropriate
 for events occurring after the balance sheet date, if such events do
 not relate to conditions existing at the balance sheet date. An example
 is the decline in market value of investments between the balance sheet
 date and the date on which the financial statements are approved.
 Ordinary fluctuations in market values do not normally relate to the
 condition of the investments at the balance sheet date, but reflect
 circumstances which have occurred in the following period.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 8.4&nbsp; Events occurring after the balance sheet date which do
 not affect the figures stated in the financial statements would not
 normally require disclosure in the financial statements although they
 may be of such significance that they may require a disclosure in the
 report of the approving authority to enable users of financial
 statements to make proper evaluations and decisions.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 8.5&nbsp; There are events which, although they take place after
 the balance sheet date, are sometimes reflected in the financial
 statements because of statutory requirements or because of their
 special nature. For example, if dividends are declared after the
 balance sheet date but before the financial statements are approved for
 issue, the dividends are not recognised as a liability at the balance
 sheet date because no obligation exists at that time unless a statute
 requires otherwise. Such dividends are disclosed in the notes.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 8.6&nbsp; Events occurring after the balance sheet date may
 indicate that the enterprise ceases to be a going concern. A
 deterioration in operating results and financial position, or unusual
 changes affecting the existence or substratum of the enterprise after
 the balance sheet date (e.g., destruction of a major production plant
 by a fire after the balance sheet date) may indicate a need to consider
 whether it is proper to use the fundamental accounting assumption of
 going concern in the preparation of the financial statements.</p>

 </strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 9.1&nbsp; The disclosure requirements herein referred to apply only
 in respect of those contingencies or events which affect the financial
 position to a material extent.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 9.2&nbsp; If a contingent loss is not provided for, its nature and
 an estimate of its financial effect are generally disclosed by way of
 note unless the possibility of a loss is remote (other than the
 circumstances mentioned in paragraph 5.5). If a reliable estimate of
 the financial effect cannot be made, this fact is disclosed.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 9.3&nbsp; When the events occurring after the balance sheet date
 are disclosed in the report of the approving authority, the information
 given comprises the nature of the events and an estimate of their
 financial effects or a statement that such an estimate cannot be made.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 204pt;"> <strong>Main Principles</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;<br>
 <strong><em>Contingencies</em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 20pt;"> <strong><em>10.&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>The
 amount of a contingent loss should be provided for by a charge in the
 statement of profit and loss if: </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> <strong><em>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>it
 is probable that future events will confirm that, after taking into
 account any related probable recovery, an asset has been impaired or a
 liability has been incurred as at the balance sheet date, and </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> <strong><em>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>a
 reasonable estimate of the amount of the resulting loss can be made. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>11.&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>The existence of
 a contingent loss should be disclosed in the financial statements if
 either of the conditions in paragraph 10 is not met, unless the
 possibility of a loss is remote. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 20pt;"> <strong><em>12.&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>Contingent
 gains should not be recognised in the financial statements. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>Events Occurring after the Balance Sheet Date</em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>13.&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>Assets and
 liabilities should be adjusted for events occurring after the balance
 sheet date that provide additional evidence to assist the estimation of
 amounts relating to conditions existing at the balance sheet date or
 that indicate that the fundamental accounting assumption of going
 concern (i.e., the continuance of existence or substratum of the
 enterprise) is not appropriate. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>14.&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>If an enterprise
 declares dividends to shareholders after the balance sheet date, the
 enterprise should not recognise those dividends as a liability at the
 balance sheet date unless a statute requires otherwise. Such dividends
 should be disclosed in notes. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>15.&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>Disclosure should
 be made in the report of the approving authority of those events
 occurring after the balance sheet date that represent material changes
 and commitments affecting the financial position of the enterprise. </em></strong></p>

 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>16.&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>If disclosure of

 <p> <em>(This Accounting Standard includes paragraphs set in <strong>bold
 italic</strong> type and plain type, which have equal authority.
 Paragraphs in bold italic type indicate the main principles. This
 Accounting Standard should be read in the context of the General
 Instructions contained in part A of the Annexure to the Notification.)</em></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Objective</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li> The objective of this Standard is to prescribe the accounting
 treatment for property, plant and equipment so that users of the
 financial statements can discern information about investment made by
 an enterprise in its property, plant and equipment and the changes in
 such investment. The principal issues in accounting for property, plant
 and equipment are the recognition of the assets, the determination of
 their carrying amounts and the depreciation charges and impairment
 losses to be recognised in relation to them.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Scope</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="2"> <strong><em>This Standard should be applied in
 accounting for property, plant and equipment except when another
 Accounting Standard requires or permits a different accounting
 treatment. </em></strong></li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="3"> This Standard does not apply to:</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 50pt;"> (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 biological assets related to agricultural activity other than bearer
 plants. This Standard applies to bearer plants but it does not apply to
 the produce on bearer plants; and</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 50pt;"> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 wasting assets including mineral rights, expenditure on the exploration
 for and extraction of minerals, oil, natural gas and similar
 non-regenerative resources.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> However, this Standard applies to property, plant and equipment
 used to develop or maintain the assets described in</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 14pt;"> (a) and (b) above.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other Accounting Standards may require
 recognition of an item of property, plant and equipment based on an
 approach different from that in this Standard. For example, AS 19,
 Leases<em>,</em> requires an enterprise to evaluate its recognition of
 an item of leased property, plant and equipment on the basis of the
 transfer of risks and rewards. However, in such cases other aspects of
 the accounting treatment for these assets, including depreciation, are
 prescribed by this Standard.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Investment property, as defined in AS 13,
 Accounting for Investments<em>,</em> should be accounted for only in
 accordance with the cost model prescribed in this standard.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Definitions</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong><em>The following
 terms are used in this Standard with the meanings specified: </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em><u>Agricultural Activity</u></em></strong><strong><em>
 is the management by an enterprise of the biological transformation and
 harvest of biological assets for sale or for conversion into
 agricultural produce or into additional biological assets. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em><u>Agricultural Produce</u></em></strong><strong><em>
 is the harvested product of biological assets of the enterprise. <u>Bearer
 plant is a plant</u> that </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 42pt;"> <strong><em>(a)&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>is
 used in the production or supply of agricultural produce; </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 42pt;"> <strong><em>(b)&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>is
 expected to bear produce for more than a&nbsp; period of twelve months;
 and </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 42pt;"> <strong><em>(c)&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>has
 a remote likelihood of being sold as agricultural produce, except for
 incidental scrap sales<u>.</u> </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> The following are not bearer plants:</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 24pt;"> (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; plants
 cultivated to be harvested as agricultural produce (for example, trees
 grown&nbsp; for use as lumber);</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 48pt;"> (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 plants cultivated to produce agricultural produce when there is more
 than a remote likelihood that the entity will also harvest and sell the
 plant as agricultural produce, other than as incidental scrap sales
 (for example, trees that are cultivated both for their fruit and their
 lumber); and</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 51pt;"> (iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 annual crops (for example, maize and wheat).</p>
 </div>
 <p style="font-family: Arial;"> &nbsp;</p>
 <div style="font-family: Arial;">
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> When bearer plants are no longer used to bear produce they might be
 cut down and sold as scrap, for example, for use as firewood. Such
 incidental scrap sales would not prevent the plant from satisfying the
 definition of a bearer plant.</p>
 </div>
 <p style="font-family: Arial;"> &nbsp;</p>
 <div style="font-family: Arial;">
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em><u>Biological Asset</u></em></strong><strong><em> is a
 living animal<sup>1</sup> or plant.</em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em><u>Carrying amount</u></em></strong><strong><em> is
 the amount at which an asset is recognised after deducting any
 accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.</em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em><u>Cost</u></em></strong><strong><em> is the amount of
 cash or cash equivalents paid or the fair value of the other
 consideration given to acquire an asset at the time of its acquisition
 or construction or, where applicable, the amount attributed to that
 asset when initially recognised in accordance with the specific
 requirements of other Accounting Standards.</em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em><u>Depreciable amount</u></em></strong><strong><em> is
 the cost of an asset, or other amount substituted for cost, less its
 residual value.</em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em><u>Depreciation</u></em></strong><strong><em> is the
 systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its
 useful life.</em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em><u>Enterprise -specific value</u></em></strong><strong><em>
 is the present value of the cash flows an enterprise expects to arise
 from the continuing use of an asset and from its disposal at the end of
 its useful life or expects to incur when settling a liability.</em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em><u>Fair value</u></em></strong><strong><em> is the
 amount for which an asset could be exchanged between knowledgeable,
 willing parties in an arm's length transaction.</em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em><u>Gross carrying amount</u></em></strong><strong><em>
 of an asset is its cost or other amount substituted for the cost in the
 books of account, without making any deduction for accumulated
 depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.</em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>An <u>impairment loss</u> is the amount by which the
 carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.</em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em><u>Property, plant and equipment</u></em></strong><strong><em>
 are tangible items that:</em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 45pt;"> <strong><em>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 </em></strong><strong><em>are held for use in the production or supply
 of goods or services, for rental to others, or for administrative
 purposes; and </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 45pt;"> <strong><em>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 </em></strong><strong><em>are expected to be used during more than
 a&nbsp; period of twelve months. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em><u>Recoverable amount</u></em></strong><strong><em> is
 the higher of an asset's net selling price and its value in use.</em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>The <u>residual value</u> of an asset is the
 estimated amount that an enterprise would currently obtain from
 disposal of the asset, after deducting the estimated costs of disposal,
 if the asset were already of the age and in the condition expected at
 the end of its useful life.</em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em><u>Useful life</u></em></strong><strong><em> is:</em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 45pt;"> <strong><em>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 </em></strong><strong><em>the period over which an asset is expected to
 be available for use by an enterprise ; or </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 45pt;"> <strong><em>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 </em></strong><strong><em>the number of production or similar units
 expected to be obtained from the asset by an enterprise. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Recognition</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong><em>The cost of an
 item of property, plant and equipment should be recognised as an asset
 if, and only if: </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 45pt;"> <strong><em>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 </em></strong><strong><em>it is probable that future economic benefits
 associated with the item will flow to the enterprise; and </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 45pt;"> <strong><em>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 </em></strong><strong><em>the cost of the item can be measured
 reliably. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Items such as spare parts, stand-by equipment
 and servicing equipment are recognised in accordance with this Standard
 when they meet the definition of property, plant and equipment.
 Otherwise, such items are classified as inventory.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Standard does not prescribe the unit of
 measure for recognition, i.e., what constitutes an item of property,
 plant and equipment. Thus, judgement is required in applying the
 recognition criteria to specific circumstances of an enterprise. An
 example of a 'unit of measure' can be a 'project' of construction of a
 manufacturing plant rather than individual assets comprising the
 project in appropriate cases for the purpose of capitalisation of
 expenditure incurred during construction period. Similarly, it may be
 appropriate to aggregate individually insignificant items, such as
 moulds, tools and dies and to apply the criteria to the aggregate
 value. An enterprise may decide to expense an item which could
 otherwise have been included as property, plant and equipment, because
 the amount of the expenditure is not material.</p>

 <p> <sup>1</sup>An Accounting Standard on Agriculture is under
 formulation, which will, inter alia, cover accounting for livestock.
 Till the time, the Accounting Standard on Agriculture is issued,
 accounting for livestock meeting the definition of Property, Plant and
 Equipment, will be covered as per AS 10 (Revised), Property, Plant and
 Equipment.</p>
 </div>
 <p style="font-family: Arial;"> &nbsp;</p>
 <div style="font-family: Arial;">
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 10.&nbsp; An enterprise evaluates under this recognition principle
 all its costs on property, plant and equipment at the time they are
 incurred. These costs include costs incurred:</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 45pt;"> (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 initially to acquire or construct an item of property, plant and
 equipment; and</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 45pt;"> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 subsequently to add to, replace part of, or service it.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Initial Costs</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 11.&nbsp; The definition of 'property, plant and equipment' covers
 tangible items which are held for use or for administrative purposes.
 The term 'administrative purposes' has been used in wider sense to
 include all business purposes other than production or supply of goods
 or services or for rental for others. Thus, property, plant and
 equipment would include assets used for selling and distribution,
 finance and accounting, personnel and other functions of an enterprise.
 Items of property, plant and equipment may also be acquired for safety
 or environmental reasons. The acquisition of such property, plant and
 equipment, although not directly increasing the future economic
 benefits of any particular existing item of property, plant and
 equipment, may be necessary for an enterprise to obtain the future
 economic benefits from its other assets. Such items of property, plant
 and equipment qualify for recognition as assets because they enable an
 enterprise to derive future economic benefits from related assets in
 excess of what could be derived had those items not been acquired. For
 example, a chemical manufacturer may install new chemical handling
 processes to comply with environmental requirements for the production
 and storage of dangerous chemicals; related plant enhancements are
 recognised as an asset because without them the enterprise is unable to
 manufacture and sell chemicals. The resulting carrying amount of such
 an asset and related assets is reviewed for impairment in accordance
 with AS 28, <em>Impairment of Assets</em>.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Subsequent Costs</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 12.&nbsp; Under the recognition principle in paragraph 7, an
 enterprise does not recognise in the carrying amount of an item of
 property, plant and equipment the costs of the day-to-day servicing of
 the item. Rather, these costs are recognised in the statement of profit
 and loss as incurred. Costs of day-to-day servicing are primarily the
 costs of labour and consumables, and may include the cost of small
 parts. The purpose of such expenditures is often described as for the
 'repairs and maintenance' of the item of property, plant and equipment.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 13.&nbsp; Parts of some items of property, plant and equipment may
 require replacement at regular intervals. For example, a furnace may
 require relining after a specified number of hours of use, or aircraft
 interiors such as seats and galleys may require replacement several
 times during the life of the airframe. Similarly, major parts of
 conveyor system, such as, conveyor belts, wire ropes, etc., may require
 replacement several times during the life of the conveyor system. Items
 of property, plant and equipment may also be acquired to make a less
 frequently recurring replacement, such as replacing the interior walls
 of a building, or to make a non-recurring replacement. Under the
 recognition principle in paragraph 7, an enterprise recognises in the
 carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment the cost of
 replacing part of such an item when that cost is incurred if the
 recognition criteria are met. The carrying amount of those parts that
 are replaced is derecognised in accordance with the derecognition
 provisions of this Standard (see paragraphs 74-80).</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 14.&nbsp; A condition of continuing to operate an item of property,
 plant and equipment (for example, an aircraft) may be performing
 regular major inspections for faults regardless of whether parts of the
 item are replaced. When each major inspection is performed, its cost is
 recognised in the carrying amount of the item of property, plant and
 equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied.
 Any remaining carrying amount of the cost of the previous inspection
 (as distinct from physical parts) is derecognised.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 15.&nbsp; The derecognition of the carrying amount as stated in
 paragraphs 13-14 occurs regardless of whether the cost of the previous
 part / inspection was identified in the transaction in which the item
 was acquired or constructed. If it is not practicable for an enterprise
 to determine the carrying amount of the replaced part/ inspection, it
 may use the cost of the replacement or the estimated cost of a future
 similar inspection as an indication of what the cost of the replaced
 part/ existing inspection component was when the item was acquired or
 constructed.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Measurement at Recognition</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>16.&nbsp; </strong><strong><em>An item of property, plant
 and equipment that qualifies for recognition as an asset should be
 measured at its cost. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Elements of Cost</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 17.&nbsp; The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment
 comprises:</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 1in;">
 (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; its purchase
 price, including import duties and non -refundable purchase taxes,,
 after deducting trade discounts and rebates.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 1in;">
 (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any costs
 directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and
 condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner
 intended by management.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 1in;">
 (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the initial
 estimate of the costs of dismantling, removing the item and restoring
 the site on which it is located, referred to as 'decommissioning,
 restoration and similar liabilities', the obligation for which an
 enterprise incurs either when the item is acquired or as a consequence
 of having used the item during a particular period for purposes other
 than to produce inventories during that period.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 18.&nbsp; Examples of directly attributable costs are:</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 1in;">
 (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; costs of

 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 19.&nbsp; An enterprise applies AS 2, Valuation of Inventories, to
 the costs of obligations for dismantling, removing and restoring the
 site on which an item is located that are incurred during a particular
 period as a consequence of having used the item to produce inventories
 during that period. The obligations for costs accounted for in
 accordance with AS 2 or AS 10 are recognised and measured in accordance
 with AS 29, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 20.&nbsp; Examples of costs that are not costs of an item of
 property, plant and equipment are:</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 1in;">
 (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; costs of
 opening a new facility or business, such as, inauguration costs;</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 1in;">
 (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; costs of
 introducing a new product or service( including costs of advertising
 and promotional activities);</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 1in;">
 (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; costs of
 conducting business in a new location or with a new class of customer
 (including costs of staff training); and</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 1in;">
 (d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 administration and other general overhead costs.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 21.&nbsp; Recognition of costs in the carrying amount of an item of
 property, plant and equipment ceases when the item is in the location
 and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner
 intended by management. Therefore, costs incurred in using or
 redeploying an item are not included in the carrying amount of that
 item. For example, the following costs are not included in the carrying
 amount of an item of property, plant and equipment:</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 1in;">
 (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; costs
 incurred while an item capable of operating in the manner intended by
 management has yet to be brought into use or is operated at less than
 full capacity;</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 1in;">
 (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; initial
 operating losses, such as those incurred while demand for the output of
 an item builds up; and</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 1in;">
 (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; costs of
 relocating or reorganising part or all of the operations of an
 enterprise.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 22.&nbsp; Some operations occur in connection with the construction
 or development of an item of property, plant and equipment, but are not
 necessary to bring the item to the location and condition necessary for
 it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
 These incidental operations may occur before or during the construction
 or development activities. For example, income may be earned through
 using a building site as a car park until construction starts. Because
 incidental operations are not necessary to bring an item to the
 location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in
 the manner intended by management, the income and related expenses of
 incidental operations are recognised in the statement of profit and
 loss and included in their respective classifications of income and
 expense.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 23.&nbsp; The cost of a self-constructed asset is determined using
 the same principles as for an acquired asset. If an enterprise makes
 similar assets for sale in the normal course of business, the cost of
 the asset is usually the same as the cost of constructing an asset for
 sale (see AS 2). Therefore, any internal profits are eliminated in
 arriving at such costs. Similarly, the cost of abnormal amounts of
 wasted material, labour, or other resources incurred in
 self-constructing an asset is not included in the cost of the asset. AS
 16, Borrowing Costs, establishes criteria for the recognition of
 interest as a component of the carrying amount of a self-constructed
 item of property, plant and equipment.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 24.&nbsp; Bearer plants are accounted for in the same way as
 self-constructed items of property, plant and equipment before they are
 in the location and condition necessary to be capable of operating in
 the manner intended by management. Consequently, references to
 'construction' in this Standard should be read as covering activities
 that are necessary to cultivate the bearer plants before they are in
 the location and condition necessary to be capable of operating in the
 manner intended by management.</p>

 <div style="font-family: Arial;">
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Measurement of Cost</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 25.&nbsp; The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment is
 the cash price equivalent at the recognition date. If payment is
 deferred beyond normal credit terms, the difference between the cash
 price equivalent and the total payment is recognised as interest over
 the period of credit unless such interest is capitalised in accordance
 with AS 16<em>.</em></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 26.&nbsp; One or more items of property, plant and equipment may be
 acquired in exchange for a non-monetary asset or assets, or a
 combination of monetary and non-monetary assets. The following
 discussion refers simply to an exchange of one non-monetary asset for
 another, but it also applies to all exchanges described in the
 preceding sentence. The cost of such an item of property, plant and
 equipment is measured at fair value unless (a) the exchange transaction
 lacks commercial substance or (b) the fair value of neither the
 asset(s) received nor the asset(s) given up is reliably measurable. The
 acquired item(s) is/are measured in this manner even if an enterprise
 cannot immediately derecognise the asset given up. If the acquired
 item(s) is/are not measured at fair value, its/their cost is measured
 at the carrying amount of the asset(s) given up.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 27.&nbsp; An enterprise determines whether an exchange transaction
 has commercial substance by considering the extent to which its future
 cash flows are expected to change as a result of the transaction. An
 exchange transaction has commercial substance if:</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 50pt;">
 (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the configuration
 (risk, timing and amount) of the cash flows of the asset received
 differs from the configuration of the cash flows of the asset
 transferred; or</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 50pt;">
 (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the
 enterprise-specific value of the portion of the operations of the
 enterprise affected by the transaction changes as a result of the
 exchange;</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 50pt;">
 (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the difference
 in (a) or (b) is significant relative to the fair value of the assets
 exchanged.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> For the purpose of determining whether an exchange transaction has
 commercial substance, the enterprise - specific value of the portion of
 operations of the enterprise affected by the transaction should reflect
 post-tax cash flows. In certain cases, the result of these analyses may
 be clear without an enterprise having to perform detailed calculations.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 28.&nbsp; The fair value of an asset is reliably measurable if (a)
 the variability in the range of reasonable fair value measurements is
 not significant for that asset or (b) the probabilities of the various
 estimates within the range can be reasonably assessed and used when
 measuring fair value. If an enterprise is able to measure reliably the
 fair value of either the asset received or the asset given up, then the
 fair value of the asset given up is used to measure the cost of the
 asset received unless the fair value of the asset received is more
 clearly evident.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 29.&nbsp; Where several items of property, plant and equipment are
 purchased for a consolidated price, the consideration is apportioned to
 the various items on the basis of their respective fair values at the
 date of acquisition. In case the fair values of the items acquired
 cannot be measured reliably, these values are estimated on a fair basis
 as determined by competent valuers.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 30.&nbsp; The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment held
 by a lessee under a finance lease is determined in accordance with AS
 19, Leases.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 31.&nbsp; The carrying amount of an item of property, plant and
 equipment may be reduced by government grants in accordance with AS 12,
 Accounting for Government Grants.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Measurement after Recognition</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>32.&nbsp; </strong><strong><em>An enterprise should
 choose either the cost model in paragraph 33 or the revaluation model
 in paragraph 34 as its accounting policy and should apply that policy
 to an entire class of property, plant and equipment. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Cost Model</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>33.&nbsp; </strong><strong><em>After recognition as an
 asset, an item of property, plant and equipment should be carried at
 its cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated
 impairment losse</em></strong>s.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Revaluation Model</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>34.&nbsp; </strong><strong><em>After recognition as an
 asset, an item of property, plant and equipment whose fair value can be
 measured reliably should be carried at a revalued amount, being its
 fair value at the date of the revaluation less any subsequent
 accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.
 Revaluations should be made with sufficient regularity to ensure that
 the carrying amount does not differ materially from that which would be
 determined using fair value at the balance sheet date. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 35.&nbsp; The fair value of items of property, plant and equipment
 is usually determined from market-based evidence by appraisal that is
 normally undertaken by professionally qualified valuers.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 </div>
 <p style="font-family: Arial;"> &nbsp;</p>
 <div style="font-family: Arial;">
 <p> 36.&nbsp; If there is no market-based evidence of fair value
 because of the specialised nature of the item of property, plant and
 equipment and the item is rarely sold, except as part of a continuing
 business, an enterprise may need to estimate fair value using an income
 approach (for example, based on discounted cash flow projections) or a
 depreciated replacement cost approach which aims at making a realistic
 estimate of the current cost of acquiring or constructing an item that
 has the same service potential as the existing item.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 37.&nbsp; The frequency of revaluations depends upon the changes in
 fair values of the items of property, plant and equipment being
 revalued. When the fair value of a revalued asset differs materially
 from its carrying amount, a further revaluation is required. Some items
 of property, plant and equipment experience significant and volatile
 changes in fair value, thus necessitating annual revaluation. Such
 frequent revaluations are unnecessary for items of property, plant and
 equipment with only insignificant changes in fair value. Instead, it
 may be necessary to revalue the item only every three or five years.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 38.&nbsp; When an item of property, plant and equipment is
 revalued, the carrying amount of that asset is adjusted to the revalued
 amount. At the date of the revaluation, the asset is treated in one of
 the following ways:</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 1in;">
 (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the gross
 carrying amount is adjusted in a manner that is consistent with the
 revaluation of the carrying amount of the asset. For example, the gross
 carrying amount may be restated by reference to observable market data
 or it may be restated proportionately to the change in the carrying
 amount. The accumulated depreciation at the date of the revaluation is
 adjusted to equal the difference between the gross carrying amount and
 the carrying amount of the asset after taking into account accumulated
 impairment losses; or</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 63pt;"> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the
 accumulated depreciation is eliminated against the gross carrying
 amount of the asset.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> The amount of the adjustment of accumulated depreciation forms part
 of the increase or decrease in carrying amount that is accounted for in
 accordance with paragraphs 42 and 43.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>39.&nbsp; </strong><strong><em>If an item of property,
 plant and equipment is revalued, the entire class of property, plant
 and equipment to which that asset belongs should be revalued. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 40.&nbsp; A class of property, plant and equipment is a grouping of
 assets of a similar nature and use in operations of an enterprise. The
 following are examples of separate classes:</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 1in;">
 (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; land;</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 1in;">
 (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; land and
 buildings;</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 1in;">
 (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; machinery;</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 1in;">
 (d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ships;</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 1in;">
 (e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; aircraft;</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 1in;">
 (f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; motor
 vehicles;</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 1in;">
 (g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; furniture and
 fixtures;</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 1in;">
 (h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; office
 equipment;and</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 1in;">
 (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 bearer plants.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 41.&nbsp; The items within a class of property, plant and equipment
 are revalued simultaneously to avoid selective revaluation of assets
 and the reporting of amounts in the financial statements that are a
 mixture of costs and values as at different dates. However, a class of
 assets may be revalued on a rolling basis provided revaluation of the
 class of assets is completed within a short period and provided the
 revaluations are kept up to date.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>42.&nbsp; </strong><strong><em>An increase in the
 carrying amount of an asset arising on revaluation should be credited
 directly to owners' interests under the heading of revaluation surplus
 However, the increase should be recognised in the statement of profit
 and loss to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the
 same asset previously recognised in the statement of profit and loss. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>43.&nbsp; </strong><strong><em>A decrease in the carrying
 amount of an asset arising on revaluation should be charged to the
 statement of profit and loss. However, the decrease should be debited
 directly to owners' interests under the heading of revaluation surplus
 to the extent of any credit balance existing in the revaluation surplus
 in respect of that asset. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 44.&nbsp; The revaluation surplus included in owners' interests in
 respect of an item of property, plant and equipment may be transferred
 to the revenue reserves when the asset is derecognised. This may
 involve transferring the whole of the surplus when the asset is retired
 or disposed of. However, some of the surplus may be transferred as the
 asset is used by an enterprise. In such a case, the amount of the
 surplus transferred would be the difference between depreciation based
 on the revalued carrying amount of the asset and depreciation based on
 its original cost. Transfers from revaluation surplus to the revenue
 reserves are not made through the statement of profit and loss.</p>
 </div>
 <div style="font-family: Arial;">
 <p> <strong>Depreciation</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>45.&nbsp; </strong><strong><em>Each part of an item of
 property, plant and equipment with a cost that is significant in
 relation to the total cost of the item should be depreciated
 separately. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 46.&nbsp; An enterprise allocates the amount initially recognised
 in respect of an item of property, plant and equipment to its
 significant parts and depreciates each such part separately. For
 example, it may be appropriate to depreciate separately the airframe
 and engines of an aircraft, whether owned or subject to a finance lease.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 47.&nbsp; A significant part of an item of property, plant and
 equipment may have a useful life and a depreciation method that are the
 same as the useful life and the depreciation method of another
 significant part of that same item. Such parts may be grouped in
 determining the depreciation charge.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 48.&nbsp; To the extent that an enterprise depreciates separately
 some parts of an item of property, plant and equipment, it also
 depreciates separately the remainder of the item. The remainder
 consists of the parts of the item that are individually not
 significant. If an enterprise has varying expectations for these parts,
 approximation techniques may be necessary to depreciate the remainder
 in a manner that faithfully represents the consumption pattern and/or
 useful life of its parts.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 49.&nbsp; An enterprise may choose to depreciate separately the
 parts of an item that do not have a cost that is significant in
 relation to the total cost of the item.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>50.&nbsp; </strong><strong><em>The depreciation charge
 for each period should be recognised in the statement of profit and
 loss unless it is included in the carrying amount of another asset. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 51.&nbsp; The depreciation charge for a period is usually
 recognised in the statement of profit and loss. However, sometimes, the
 future economic benefits embodied in an asset are absorbed in producing
 other assets. In this case, the depreciation charge constitutes part of
 the cost of the other asset and is included in its carrying amount. For
 example, the depreciation of manufacturing plant and equipment is
 included in the costs of conversion of inventories (see AS 2).
 Similarly, the depreciation of property, plant and equipment used for
 development activities may be included in the cost of an intangible
 asset recognised in accordance with AS 26, <em>Intangible</em> <em>Assets</em>.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Depreciable Amount and Depreciation Period</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>52.&nbsp; </strong><strong><em>The depreciable amount of
 an asset should be allocated on a systematic basis over its useful
 life. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>53.&nbsp; </strong><strong><em>The residual value and the
 useful life of an asset should be reviewed at least at each financial
 year-end and, if expectations differ from previous estimates, the
 change(s) should be accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate
 in accordance with AS 5, Net Profit or Loss for the Period, Prior
 Period Items and Changes in Accounting Policies. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 54.&nbsp; Depreciation is recognised even if the fair value of the
 asset exceeds its carrying amount, as long as the asset's residual
 value does not exceed its carrying amount. Repair and maintenance of an
 asset do not negate the need to depreciate it.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 55.&nbsp; The depreciable amount of an asset is determined after
 deducting its residual value.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 56.&nbsp; The residual value of an asset may increase to an amount
 equal to or greater than its carrying amount. If it does, depreciation
 charge of the asset is zero unless and until its residual value
 subsequently decreases to an amount below its carrying amount.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 57.&nbsp; Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for
 use, <em>i.e.</em>, when it is in the location and condition necessary
 for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
 Depreciation of an asset ceases at the earlier of the date that the
 asset is retired from active use and is held for disposal and the date
 that the asset is derecognised. Therefore, depreciation does not cease
 when the asset becomes idle or is retired from active use (but not held
 for disposal) unless the asset is fully depreciated. However, under
 usage methods of depreciation, the depreciation charge can be zero
 while there is no production.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 58.&nbsp; The future economic benefits embodied in an asset are
 consumed by an enterprise principally through its use. However, other
 factors, such as technical or commercial obsolescence and wear and tear
 while an asset remains idle, often result in the diminution of the
 economic benefits that might have been obtained from the asset.
 Consequently, all the following factors are considered in determining
 the useful life of an asset:</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 1in;">
 (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; expected
 usage of the asset. Usage is assessed by reference to the expected
 capacity or physical output of the asset.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 1in;">
 (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; expected
 physical wear and tear, which depends on operational factors such as
 the number of shifts for which the asset is to be used and the repair
 and maintenance programme, and the care and maintenance of the asset
 while idle.</p>
 </div>
 <p style="font-family: Arial;"> &nbsp;</p>
 <div style="font-family: Arial;">
 <p style="margin-left: 68pt;">
 (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; technical or
 commercial obsolescence arising from changes or improvements in
 production, or from a change in the market demand for the product or
 service output of the asset. Expected future reductions in the selling
 price of an item that was produced using an asset could indicate the
 expectation of technical or commercial obsolescence of the asset,
 which, in turn, might reflect a reduction of the future economic
 benefits embodied in the asset.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 1in;">
 (d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; legal or
 similar limits on the use of the asset, such as the expiry dates of
 related leases.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 59.&nbsp; The useful life of an asset is defined in terms of its
 expected utility to the enterprise. The asset management policy of the
 enterprise may involve the disposal of assets after a specified time or
 after consumption of a specified proportion of the future economic
 benefits embodied in the asset. Therefore, the useful life of an asset
 may be shorter than its economic life. The estimation of the useful
 life of the asset is a matter of judgement based on the experience of
 the enterprise with similar assets.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 60.&nbsp; Land and buildings are separable assets and are accounted
 for separately, even when they are acquired together. With some
 exceptions, such as quarries and sites used for landfill, land has an
 unlimited useful life and therefore is not depreciated. Buildings have
 a limited useful life and therefore are depreciable assets. An increase
 in the value of the land on which a building stands does not affect the
 determination of the depreciable amount of the building.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 61.&nbsp; If the cost of land includes the costs of site
 dismantlement, removal and restoration, that portion of the land asset
 is depreciated over the period of benefits obtained by incurring those
 costs. In some cases, the land itself may have a limited useful life,
 in which case it is depreciated in a manner that reflects the benefits
 to be derived from it.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;<br>
 <strong>Depreciation Method</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>62.&nbsp; </strong><strong><em>The depreciation method
 used should reflect the pattern in which the future economic benefits
 of the asset are expected to be consumed by the enterprise. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>63.&nbsp; </strong><strong><em>The depreciation method
 applied to an asset should be reviewed at least at each financial
 year-end and, if there has been a significant change in the expected
 pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the
 asset, the method should be changed to reflect the changed pattern.
 Such a change should be accounted for as a change in an accounting
 estimate in accordance with AS 5. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 64.&nbsp; A variety of depreciation methods can be used to allocate
 the depreciable amount of an asset on a systematic basis over its
 useful life. These methods include the straight-line method, the
 diminishing balance method and the units of production method.
 Straight-line depreciation results in a constant charge over the useful
 life if the residual value of the asset does not change. The
 diminishing balance method results in a decreasing charge over the
 useful life. The units of production method results in a charge based
 on the expected use or output. The enterprise selects the method that
 most closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of the future
 economic benefits embodied in the asset. That method is applied
 consistently from period to period unless there is a change in the
 expected pattern of consumption of those future economic benefits or
 that the method is changed in accordance with the statute to best
 reflect the way the asset is consumed.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 65.&nbsp; A depreciation method that is based on revenue that is
 generated by an activity that includes the use of an asset is not
 appropriate. The revenue generated by an activity that includes the use
 of an asset generally reflects factors other than the consumption of
 the economic benefits of the asset. For example, revenue is affected by
 other inputs and processes, selling activities and changes in sales
 volumes and prices. The price component of revenue may be affected by
 inflation, which has no bearing upon the way in which an asset is
 consumed.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Changes in Existing Decommissioning, Restoration and Other
 Liabilities</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>66.&nbsp; </strong><strong><em>The cost of property,
 plant and equipment may undergo changes subsequent to its acquisition
 or construction on account of changes in liabilities, price
 adjustments, changes in duties, changes in initial estimates of amounts
 provided for dismantling, removing, restoration and similar factors and
 included in the cost of the asset in accordance with paragraph 16. Such
 changes in cost should be accounted for in accordance with paragraphs
 67-68 below. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>67.&nbsp; </strong><strong><em>If the related asset is
 measured using the cost model: </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 50pt;"> <strong><em>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 </em></strong><strong><em>subject to (b), changes in the liability

 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 50pt;"> <strong><em>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 </em></strong><strong><em>the amount deducted from the cost of the
 asset should not exceed its carrying amount. If a decrease in the
 liability exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, the excess should
 be recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss. </em></strong></p>

 </em></strong><strong><em>if the adjustment results in an addition to

 the asset for impairment by estimating its recoverable amount, and
 should account for any impairment loss, in accordance with AS 28. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>

 <p style="margin-left: 1.5in;"> <strong><em>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 </em></strong><strong><em>a decrease in the liability should (subject

 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 1.5in;"> <strong><em>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 </em></strong><strong><em>an increase in the liability should be

 the extent of any credit balance existing in the revaluation surplus in
 respect of that asset. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 1in;"> <strong><em>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 </em></strong><strong><em>in the event that a decrease in the liability
 exceeds the carrying amount that would have been recognised had the
 asset been carried under the cost model, the excess should be
 recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 1in;"> <strong><em>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 </em></strong><strong><em>a change in the liability is an indication
 that the asset may have to be revalued in order to ensure that the
 carrying amount does not differ materially from that which would be
 determined using fair value at the balance sheet date. Any such
 revaluation should be taken into account in determining the amounts to
 be taken to the statement of profit and loss and the owners' interest
 under (a). If a revaluation is necessary, all assets of that class
 should be revalued. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>69.&nbsp; </strong><strong><em>The adjusted depreciable
 amount of the asset is depreciated over its useful life. Therefore,
 once the related asset has reached the end of its useful life, all
 subsequent changes in the liability should be recognised in the
 statement of profit and loss as they occur. This applies under both the
 cost model and the revaluation model. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;<br>
 <strong>Impairment</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 70.&nbsp; To determine whether an item of property, plant and
 equipment is impaired, an enterprise applies AS 28, Impairment of
 Assets. AS 28 explains how an enterprise reviews the carrying amount of
 its assets, how it determines the recoverable amount of an asset, and
 when it recognises, or reverses the recognition of, an impairment loss.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Compensation for Impairment</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>71.&nbsp; </strong><strong><em>Compensation from third
 parties for items of property, plant and equipment that were impaired,
 lost or given up should be included in the statement of profit and loss
 when the compensation becomes receivable. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 72.&nbsp; Impairments or losses of items of property, plant and
 equipment, related claims for or payments of compensation from third
 parties and any subsequent purchase or construction of replacement
 assets are separate economic events and are accounted for separately as
 follows:</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 1in;">
 (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; impairments
 of items of property, plant and equipment are recognised in accordance
 with AS 28;</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 1in;">
 (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; derecognition
 of items of property, plant and equipment retired or disposed of is
 determined in accordance with this Standard;</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 1in;">
 (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; compensation
 from third parties for items of property, plant and equipment that were
 impaired, lost or given up is included in determining profit or loss
 when it becomes receivable; and</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 1in;">
 (d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the cost of
 items of property, plant and equipment restored, purchased or
 constructed as replacements is determined in accordance with this
 Standard.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;<br>
 <strong>Retirements</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>73.&nbsp; </strong><strong><em>Items of property, plant
 and equipment retired from active use and held for disposal should be
 stated at the lower of their carrying amount and net realisable value.
 Any write-down in this regard should be recognised immediately in the
 statement of profit and loss. </em></strong></p>
 </div>
 <div style="font-family: Arial;">
 <p> <strong>Derecognition</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>74.&nbsp; </strong><strong><em>The carrying amount of an
 item of property, plant and equipment should be derecognised </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 1in;"> <strong><em>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 </em></strong><strong><em>on disposal; or </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 1in;"> <strong><em>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 </em></strong><strong><em>when no future economic benefits are expected
 from its use or disposal. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>75.&nbsp; </strong><strong><em>The gain or loss arising
 from the derecognition of an item of property, plant and equipment
 should be included in the statement of profit and loss when the item is
 derecognised (unless AS 19, Leases, requires otherwise on a sale and
 leaseback). Gains should not be classified as revenue, as defined in AS
 9, Revenue Recognition. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>76.&nbsp; </strong><strong><em>However, an enterprise
 that in the course of its ordinary activities, routinely sells items of
 property, plant and equipment that it had held for rental to others
 should transfer such assets to inventories at their carrying amount
 when they cease to be rented and become held for sale. The proceeds
 from the sale of such assets should be recognised in revenue in
 accordance with AS 9, Revenue Recognition. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 77.&nbsp; The disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment
 may occur in a variety of ways (e.g. by sale, by entering into a
 finance lease or by donation). In determining the date of disposal of
 an item, an enterprise applies the criteria in AS 9 for recognising
 revenue from the sale of goods. AS 19, Leases, applies to disposal by a
 sale and leaseback.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 78.&nbsp; If, under the recognition principle in paragraph 7, an
 enterprise recognises in the carrying amount of an item of property,
 plant and equipment the cost of a replacement for part of the item,
 then it derecognises the carrying amount of the replaced part
 regardless of whether the replaced part had been depreciated
 separately. If it is not practicable for an enterprise to determine the
 carrying amount of the replaced part, it may use the cost of the
 replacement as an indication of what the cost of the replaced part was
 at the time it was acquired or constructed.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>79.&nbsp; </strong><strong><em>The gain or loss arising
 from the derecognition of an item of property, plant and equipment
 should be determined as the difference between the net disposal
 proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of the item. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 80.&nbsp; The consideration receivable on disposal of an item of
 property, plant and equipment is recognised in accordance with the
 principles enunciated in AS 9.</p>

 <p> 83.&nbsp; Selection of the depreciation method and estimation of
 the useful life of assets are matters of judgement. Therefore,
 disclosure of the methods adopted and the estimated useful lives or
 depreciation rates provides users of financial statements with
 information that allows them to review the policies selected by
 management and enables comparisons to be made with other enterprises.
 For similar reasons, it is necessary to disclose:</p>

 <p style="margin-left: 1in;">
 (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; depreciation,
 whether recognised in the statement of profit and loss or as a part of

 (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; accumulated
 depreciation at the end of the period.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 84.&nbsp; In accordance with AS 5, an enterprise discloses the
 nature and effect of a change in an accounting estimate that has an
 effect in the current period or is expected to have an effect in
 subsequent periods. For property, plant and equipment, such disclosure
 may arise from changes in estimates with respect to:</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 1in;">
 (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; residual
 values;</p>

 property, plant and equipment reflects any previous revaluation it
 should adjust the amount outstanding in the revaluation reserve against
 the carrying amount of that item. However, the carrying amount of that
 item should never be less than residual value. Any excess of the amount

 <p> <strong>Definitions</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 20pt;"> <strong><em>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>The
 following terms are used in this Standard with the meanings assigned: </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>3.1&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em><u>Investments</u></em></strong><strong><em>
 are assets held by an enterprise for earning income by way of
 dividends, interest, and rentals, for capital appreciation, or for
 other benefits to the investing enterprise. Assets held as
 stock-in-trade are not 'investments'. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>3.2&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em><u>A current
 investment</u></em></strong><strong><em> is an investment that is by
 its nature readily realisable and is intended to be held for not more
 than one year from the date on which such investment is made. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 20pt;"> <strong><em>3.3&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em><u>A
 long term&nbsp; investment</u></em></strong><strong><em> is an
 investment other than a current investment. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>3.4&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em><u>An investment
 property</u></em></strong><strong><em> is an investment in land or
 buildings that are not intended to be occupied substantially for use
 by, or in the operations of, the investing enterprise. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>3.5&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em><u>Fair value</u></em></strong><strong><em>
 is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged between a
 knowledgeable, willing buyer and a knowledgeable, willing seller in an
 arm's length transaction. Under appropriate circumstances, market value
 or net realisable value provides an evidence of fair value. </em></strong></p>
 </div>
 <div style="font-family: Arial;"> <sup>2</sup>Shares, debentures and
 other securities held as stock-in-trade (i.e., for sale in the ordinary
 course of business) are not 'investments' as defined in</div>
 <div style="font-family: Arial;">
 <p> this Standard. However, the manner in which they are accounted for
 and disclosed in the financial statements is quite similar to that
 applicable in respect of current investments. Accordingly, the
 provisions of this Standard, to the extent that they relate to current
 investments, are also applicable to shares, debentures and other
 securities held as stock-in-trade, with suitable modifications as
 specified in this Standard.</p>
 </div>
 <div style="font-family: Arial;">
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>3.6&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em><u>Market value</u></em></strong><strong><em>
 is the amount obtainable from the sale of an investment in an open
 market, net of expenses necessarily to be incurred on or before
 disposal. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;<br>
 <strong>Explanation</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;<br>
 <strong>Forms of Investments</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="4"> Enterprises hold investments for diverse reasons. For
 some enterprises, investment activity is a significant element of
 operations, and assessment of the performance of the enterprise may
 largely, or solely, depend on the reported results of this activity.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="5"> Some investments have no physical existence and are
 represented merely by certificates or similar documents (e.g., shares)
 while others exist in a physical form (e.g., buildings). The nature of
 an investment may be that of a debt, other than a short or long term
 loan or a trade debt, representing a monetary amount owing to the
 holder and usually bearing interest; alternatively, it may be a stake
 in the results and net assets of an enterprise such as an equity share.
 Most investments represent financial rights, but some are tangible,
 such as certain investments in land or buildings.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="6"> For some investments, an active market exists from
 which a market value can be established. For such investments, market
 value generally provides the best evidence of fair value. For other
 investments, an active market does not exist and other means are used
 to determine fair value.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Classification of Investments</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="7"> Enterprises present financial statements that classify
 fixed assets, investments and current assets into separate</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> categories. Investments are classified as long term investments and
 current investments. Current investments are in the nature of current
 assets, although the common practice may be to include them in
 investments.<sup>3</sup></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="8"> Investments other than current investments are
 classified as long term investments, even though they may be readily
 marketable.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Cost of Investments</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 30pt;"> 9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cost of an
 investment includes acquisition charges such as brokerage, fees and
 duties.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 30pt;"> 10.&nbsp; If an investment is acquired,
 or partly acquired, by the issue of shares or other securities, the
 acquisition cost is the fair value of the securities issued (which, in
 appropriate cases, may be indicated by the issue price as determined by
 statutory authorities). The fair value may not necessarily be equal to
 the nominal or par value of the securities issued.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 30pt;"> 11.&nbsp; If an investment is acquired
 in exchange, or part exchange, for another asset, the acquisition cost
 of the investment is determined by reference to the fair value of the
 asset given up. It may be appropriate to consider the fair value of the
 investment acquired if it is more clearly evident.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 30pt;"> 12.&nbsp; Interest, dividends and
 rentals receivables in connection with an investment are generally
 regarded as income, being the return on the investment. However, in
 some circumstances, such inflows represent a recovery of cost and do
 not form part of income. For example, when unpaid interest has accrued
 before the acquisition of an interest-bearing investment and is
 therefore included in the price paid for the investment, the subsequent
 receipt of interest is allocated between pre-acquisition and
 post-acquisition periods; the pre-acquisition portion is deducted from
 cost. When dividends on equity are declared from pre-acquisition
 profits, a similar treatment may apply. If it is difficult to make such
 an allocation except on an arbitrary basis, the cost of investment is
 normally reduced by dividends receivable only if they clearly represent
 a recovery of a part of the cost.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 30pt;"> 13.&nbsp; When right shares offered are
 subscribed for, the cost of the right shares is added to the carrying
 amount of the original holding. If rights are not subscribed for but
 are sold in the market, the sale proceeds are taken to the profit and
 loss statement. However, where the investments are acquired on
 cum-right basis and the market value of investments immediately after
 their becoming ex-right is lower than the cost for which they were
 acquired, it may be appropriate to apply the sale proceeds of rights to
 reduce the carrying amount of such investments to the market value.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;<br>
 <sup>3</sup>Shares, debentures and other securities held for sale in
 the ordinary course of business are disclosed as 'stock-in-trade' under
 the head 'current&nbsp; assets'.</p>
 </div>
 <div style="font-family: Arial;">
 <p> &nbsp;<br>
 <strong>Carrying Amount of Investments</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;<em>Current Investments</em></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="14"> The carrying amount for current investments is the
 lower of cost and fair value. In respect of investments for which an
 active market exists, market value generally provides the best evidence
 of fair value. The valuation of current investments at lower of cost
 and fair value provides a prudent method of determining the carrying
 amount to be stated in the balance sheet.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="15"> Valuation of current investments on overall (or
 global) basis is not considered appropriate. Sometimes, the concern of
 an enterprise may be with the value of a category of related current
 investments and not with each individual investment, and accordingly
 the investments may be carried at the lower of cost and fair value
 computed categorywise (i.e. equity shares, preference shares,
 convertible debentures, etc.). However, the more prudent and
 appropriate method is to carry investments individually at the lower of
 cost and fair value.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="16"> For current investments, any reduction to fair value
 and any reversals of such reductions are included in the profit and
 loss statement.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>Long-term Investments</em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="17"> Long-term investments are usually carried at cost.
 However, when there is a decline, other than temporary, in the value of
 a long term investment, the carrying amount is reduced to recognise the
 decline. Indicators of the value of an investment are obtained by
 reference to its market value, the investee's assets and results and
 the expected cash flows from the investment. The type and extent of the
 investor's stake in the investee are also taken into account.
 Restrictions on distributions by the investee or on disposal by the
 investor may affect the value attributed to the investment.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="18"> Long-term investments are usually of individual
 importance to the investing enterprise. The carrying amount of
 long-term investments is therefore determined on an individual
 investment basis.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="19"> Where there is a decline, other than temporary, in
 the carrying amounts of long term investments, the resultant reduction
 in the carrying amount is charged to the profit and loss statement. The
 reduction in carrying amount is reversed when there is a rise in the
 value of the investment, or if the reasons for the reduction no longer
 exist.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Investment Properties</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 20. An investment property is accounted for in accordance with cost
 model as prescribed in Accounting Standard (AS) 10, <em>Property,
 Plant and Equipment</em>. The cost of any shares in a co-operative
 society or a company, the holding of which is directly related to the
 right to hold the investment property, is added to the carrying amount
 of the investment property.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Disposal of Investments</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="21"> On disposal of an investment, the difference between
 the carrying amount and the disposal proceeds, net of expenses, is
 recognised in the profit and loss statement.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="22"> When disposing of a part of the holding of an
 individual investment, the carrying amount to be allocated to</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> that part is to be determined on the basis of the average carrying
 amount of the total holding of the investment.<sup>4</sup></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Reclassification of Investments</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="23"> Where long-term investments are reclassified as
 current investments, transfers are made at the lower of cost and
 carrying amount at the date of transfer.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="24"> Where investments are reclassified from current to
 long-term, transfers are made at the lower of cost and fair value at
 the date of transfer.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>

 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Explanation</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Types of Amalgamations</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Generally speaking, amalgamations fall into
 two broad categories. In the first category are those amalgamations
 where there is a genuine pooling not merely of the assets and
 liabilities of the amalgamating companies but also of the shareholders'
 interests and of the businesses of these companies. Such amalgamations
 are amalgamations which are in the nature of 'merger' and the
 accounting treatment of such amalgamations should ensure that the
 resultant figures of assets, liabilities, capital and reserves more or
 less represent the sum of the relevant figures of the amalgamating
 companies. In the second category are those amalgamations which are in
 effect a mode by which one company acquires another company and, as a
 consequence, the shareholders of the company which is acquired normally
 do not continue to have a proportionate share in the equity of the
 combined company, or the business of the company which is acquired is
 not intended to be continued. Such amalgamations are amalgamations in
 the nature of 'purchase'.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An amalgamation is classified as an
 'amalgamation in the nature of merger' when all the conditions listed
 in paragraph 3(e) are satisfied. There are, however, differing views
 regarding the nature of any further conditions that may apply. Some
 believe that, in addition to an exchange of equity shares, it is
 necessary that the shareholders of the transferor company obtain a
 substantial share in the transferee company even to the extent that it
 should not be possible to identify any one party as dominant therein.
 This belief is based in part on the view that the exchange of control
 of one company for an insignificant share in a larger company does not
 amount to a mutual sharing of risks and benefits.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Others believe that the substance of an
 amalgamation in the nature of merger is evidenced by meeting certain
 criteria regarding the relationship of the parties, such as the former
 independence of the amalgamating companies, the manner of their
 amalgamation, the absence of planned transactions that would undermine
 the effect of the amalgamation, and the continuing participation by the
 management of the transferor company in the management of the
 transferee company after the amalgamation.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <sup>?</sup>As defined in AS 21, Consolidated Financial Statements </div>
 <div style="font-family: Arial;">
 <p> <strong>Methods of Accounting for Amalgamations</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="7"> There are two main methods of accounting for
 amalgamations:</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 1in;">
 (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the pooling of
 interests method; and</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 1in;">
 (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the purchase method.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="8"> The use of the pooling of interests method is confined
 to circumstances which meet the criteria referred to in paragraph 3(e)
 for an amalgamation in the nature of merger.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="9"> The object of the purchase method is to account for
 the amalgamation by applying the same principles as are applied in the
 normal purchase of assets. This method is used in accounting for
 amalgamations in the nature of purchase.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <em>The Pooling of Interests Method</em></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="10"> Under the pooling of interests method, the assets,
 liabilities and reserves of the transferor company are recorded by the
 transferee company at their existing carrying amounts (after making the
 adjustments required in paragraph 11).</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="11"> If, at the time of the amalgamation, the transferor
 and the transferee companies have conflicting accounting policies, a
 uniform set of accounting policies is adopted following the
 amalgamation. The effects on the financial statements of any changes in
 accounting policies are reported in accordance with Accounting Standard
 (AS) 5, Net Profit or Loss for the Period, Prior Period Items and
 Changes in Accounting Policies.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <em>The Purchase Method</em></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="12"> Under the purchase method, the transferee company
 accounts for the amalgamation either by incorporating the assets and
 liabilities at their existing carrying amounts or by allocating the
 consideration to individual identifiable assets and liabilities of the
 transferor company on the basis of their fair values at the date of
 amalgamation. The identifiable assets and liabilities may include
 assets and liabilities not recorded in the financial statements of the
 transferor company.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="13"> Where assets and liabilities are restated on the
 basis of their fair values, the determination of fair values may be
 influenced by the intentions of the transferee company. For example,
 the transferee company may have a specialised use for an asset, which
 is not available to other potential buyers. The transferee company may
 intend to effect changes in the activities of the transferor company
 which necessitate the creation of specific provisions for the expected
 costs, e.g. planned employee termination and plant relocation costs.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Consideration</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="14"> The consideration for the amalgamation may consist of
 securities, cash or other assets. In determining the value of the
 consideration, an assessment is made of the fair value of its elements.
 A variety of techniques is applied in arriving at fair value. For
 example, when the consideration includes securities, the value fixed by
 the statutory authorities may be taken to be the fair value. In case of
 other assets, the fair value may be determined by reference to the
 market value of the assets given up. Where the market value of the
 assets given up cannot be reliably assessed, such assets may be valued
 at their respective net book values.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="15"> Many amalgamations recognise that adjustments may
 have to be made to the consideration in the light of one or more future
 events. When the additional payment is probable and can reasonably be
 estimated at the date of amalgamation, it is included in the
 calculation of the consideration. In all other cases, the adjustment is
 recognised as soon as the amount is determinable [see Accounting
 Standard (AS) 4, Contingencies and Events Occurring After the Balance
 Sheet Date].</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Treatment of Reserves on Amalgamation</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="16"> If the amalgamation is an 'amalgamation in the nature
 of merger', the identity of the reserves is preserved and they appear
 in the financial statements of the transferee company in the same form
 in which they appeared in the financial statements of the transferor
 company. Thus, for example, the General Reserve of the transferor
 company becomes the General Reserve of the transferee company, the
 Capital Reserve of the transferor company becomes the Capital Reserve
 of the transferee company and the Revaluation Reserve of the transferor
 company becomes the Revaluation Reserve of the transferee company. As a
 result of preserving the identity, reserves which are available for
 distribution as dividend before the amalgamation would also be
 available for distribution as dividend after the amalgamation. The
 difference between the amount recorded as share capital issued (plus
 any additional consideration in the form of cash or other assets) and
 the amount of share capital of the transferor company is adjusted is
 reserves in the financial statements of the transferee company.</li>
 </ol>
 </div>
 <div style="font-family: Arial;">
 <ol>
 <li value="17"> If the amalgamation is an 'amalgamation in the nature
 of purchase', the identity of the reserves, other than the statutory
 reserves dealt with in paragraph 18, is not preserved. The amount of
 the consideration is deducted from the value of the net assets of the
 transferor company acquired by the transferee company. If the result of
 the computation is negative, the difference is debited to goodwill
 arising on amalgamation and dealt with in the manner stated in
 paragraphs 19-20. If the result of the computation is positive, the
 difference is credited to Capital Reserve.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="18"> Certain reserves may have been created by the
 transferor company pursuant to the requirements of, or to avail of the
 benefits under, the Income-tax Act, 1961; for example, Development
 Allowance Reserve, or Investment Allowance Reserve. The Act requires
 that the identity of the reserves should be preserved for a specified
 period. Likewise, certain other reserves may have been created in the
 financial statements of the transferor company in terms of the
 requirements of other statutes. Though, normally, in an amalgamation in
 the nature of purchase, the identity of reserves is not preserved, an
 exception is made in respect of reserves of the aforesaid nature
 (referred to hereinafter as 'statutory reserves') and such reserves
 retain their identity in the financial statements of the transferee
 company in the same form in which they appeared in the financial
 statements of the transferor company, so long as their identity is
 required to be maintained to comply with the relevant statute. This
 exception is made only in those amalgamations where the requirements of
 the relevant statute for recording the statutory reserves in the books
 of the transferee company are complied with. In such cases the
 statutory reserves are recorded in the financial statements of the
 transferee company by a corresponding debit to a suitable account head
 (e.g., 'Amalgamation Adjustment Reserve') which is presented as a
 separate line item. When the identity of the statutory reserves is no
 longer required to be maintained, both the reserves and the aforesaid
 account are reversed.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Treatment of Goodwill Arising on Amalgamation</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="19"> Goodwill arising on amalgamation represents a payment
 made in anticipation of future income and it is appropriate to treat it
 as an asset to be amortised to income on a systematic basis over its
 useful life. Due to the nature of goodwill, it is frequently difficult
 to estimate its useful life with reasonable certainty. Such estimation
 is, therefore, made on a prudent basis. Accordingly, it is considered
 appropriate to amortise goodwill over a period not exceeding five years
 unless a somewhat longer period can be justified.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="20"> Factors which may be considered in estimating the
 useful life of goodwill arising on amalgamation include:</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> (a)&nbsp;&nbsp; the foreseeable life of
 the business or industry;</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp; the effects of product
 obsolescence, changes in demand and other economic factors;</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> (c)&nbsp;&nbsp; the service life
 expectancies of key individuals or groups of employees;</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> (d)&nbsp;&nbsp; expected actions by
 competitors or potential competitors; and</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> (e)&nbsp;&nbsp; legal, regulatory or
 contractual provisions affecting the useful life.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Balance of Profit and Loss Account</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="21"> In the case of an 'amalgamation in the nature of
 merger', the balance of the Profit and Loss Account appearing in the
 financial statements of the transferor company is aggregated with the
 corresponding balance appearing in the financial statements of the
 transferee company. Alternatively, it is transferred to the General
 Reserve, if any.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="22"> In the case of an 'amalgamation in the nature of
 purchase', the balance of the Profit and Loss Account appearing in the
 financial statements of the transferor company, whether debit or
 credit, loses its identity.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <em>Treatment of Reserves Specified in A Scheme of Amalgamation</em></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 23.<sup>?</sup> The scheme of amalgamation sanctioned under the
 provisions of the Companies Act, 1956 or any other statute may
 prescribe the treatment to be given to the reserves of the transferor
 company after its amalgamation. Where the treatment is so prescribed,
 the same is followed. In some cases, the scheme of amalgamation
 sanctioned under a statute may prescribe a different treatment to be
 given to the reserves of the transferor company after amalgamation as
 compared to the requirements of this Standard that would have been
 followed had no treatment been prescribed by the scheme. In such cases,
 the following disclosures are made in the first financial statements
 following the amalgamation:</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> (a)&nbsp; A description of the
 accounting treatment given to the reserves and the reasons for
 following the treatment different from that prescribed in this Standard.</p>

 italic</strong> type and plain type, which have equal authority.
 Paragraphs in bold italic type indicate the main principles. This
 Accounting Standard should be read in the context of its objective and
 the General Instructions contained in part A of the Annexure to the
 Notification.)</em></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Objective</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> The objective of this Standard is to lay down principles and
 procedures for preparation and presentation of consolidated financial
 statements. Consolidated financial statements are presented by a parent
 (also known as holding enterprise) to provide financial information
 about the economic activities of its group. These statements are
 intended to present financial information about a parent and its
 subsidiary (ies) as a single economic entity to show the economic
 resources controlled by the group, the obligations of the group and
 results the group achieves with its resources.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Scope</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>1. This Standard should be applied in the preparation
 and presentation of consolidated financial statements for a group of
 enterprises under the control of a parent.</em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>This
 Standard should also be applied in accounting for investments in
 subsidiaries in the separate financial statements of a parent. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the preparation of consolidated financial
 statements, other Accounting Standards also apply in the same manner as
 they apply to the separate statements.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 20pt;"> 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Standard
 does not deal with:</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> (a)&nbsp;&nbsp; methods of accounting
 for amalgamations and their effects on consolidation, including
 goodwill arising on amalgamation (see AS 14, Accounting for
 Amalgamations);</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp; accounting for
 investments in associates (at present governed by AS 13, Accounting for
 Investments<sup>6</sup> ); and</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> (c)&nbsp;&nbsp; accounting for
 investments in joint ventures (at present governed by AS 13, Accounting
 for Investments<sup>7</sup> ).</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Definitions</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>5. For the purpose of this Standard, the following
 terms are used with the meanings specified:</em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 20pt;"> <strong>5.1&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong><u>Control:
 </u></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> <strong><em>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>the
 ownership, directly or indirectly through subsidiary(ies), of more than
 one-half of the voting power of an enterprise; or </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> <strong><em>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>control
 of the composition of the board of directors in the case of a company
 or of the composition of the corresponding governing body in case of
 any other enterprise so as to obtain economic benefits from its
 activities. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>5.2&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>A <u>subsidiary</u>
 is an enterprise that is controlled by another enterprise (known as the
 parent). </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 20pt;"> <strong><em>5.3&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>A
 <u>parent</u> is an enterprise that has one or more subsidiaries. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 20pt;"> <strong><em>5.4&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>A
 <u>group</u> is a parent and all its subsidiaries. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>5.5&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em><u>Consolidated
 financial statements</u></em></strong><strong><em> are the financial
 statements of a group presented as those of a single enterprise. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>5.6&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em><u>Equity</u></em></strong><strong><em>
 is the residual interest in the assets of an enterprise after deducting
 all its liabilities. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>5.7&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em><u>Minority
 interest</u></em></strong><strong><em> is that part of the net results
 of operations and of the net assets of a subsidiary attributable to
 interests which are not owned, directly or indirectly through
 subsidiary(ies), by the parent. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <sup>5</sup> It is clarified that AS 21 is mandatory if an
 enterprise presents consolidated financial statements. In other words,
 the accounting standard does not mandate an enterprise to present
 consolidated financial statements but, if the enterprise presents
 consolidated financial statements for complying with the requirements

 <p> 6. Consolidated financial statements normally include consolidated
 balance sheet, consolidated statement of profit and loss, and notes,
 other statements and explanatory material that form an integral part
 thereof. Consolidated cash flow statement is presented in case a parent
 presents its own cash flow statement. The consolidated financial
 statements are presented, to the extent possible, in the same format as
 that adopted by the parent for its separate financial statements.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;<br>
 Explanation:</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> All the notes appearing in the separate financial statements of the
 parent enterprise and its subsidiaries need not be included in the
 notes to the consolidated financial statements. For preparing
 consolidated financial statements, the following principles may be
 observed in respect of notes and other explanatory material that form
 an integral part thereof:</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> (a)&nbsp; Notes which are necessary for
 presenting a true and fair view of the consolidated financial
 statements are included in the consolidated financial statements as an
 integral part thereof.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> (b)&nbsp; Only the notes involving items
 which are material need to be disclosed. Materiality for this purpose
 is assessed in relation to the information contained in consolidated
 financial statements. In view of this, it is possible that certain
 notes which are disclosed in separate financial statements of a parent
 or a subsidiary would not be required to be disclosed in the
 consolidated financial statements when the test of materiality is
 applied in the context of consolidated financial statements.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> (c)&nbsp; Additional statutory
 information disclosed in separate financial statements of the
 subsidiary and/or a parent having no bearing on the true and fair view
 of the consolidated financial statements need not be disclosed in the
 consolidated financial statements. An illustration of such information
 in the case of companies is attached to the Standard.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Presentation of Consolidated Financial Statements</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="7"> <strong><em>A parent which presents consolidated
 financial statements should present these statements in addition to its
 separate financial statements. </em></strong></li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="8"> Users of the financial statements of a parent are
 usually concerned with, and need to be informed about, the financial
 position and results of operations of not only the enterprise itself
 but also of the group as a whole. This need is served by providing the
 users -</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 60pt;"> (a)&nbsp;&nbsp; separate financial
 statements of the parent; and</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 60pt;"> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp; consolidated financial
 statements, which present financial information about the group as that
 of a single enterprise without regard to the legal boundaries of the
 separate legal entities.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Scope of Consolidated Financial Statements</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="9"> <strong><em>A parent which presents consolidated
 financial statements should consolidate all subsidiaries, domestic as
 well as foreign, other than those referred to in paragraph 11. Where an
 enterprise does not have a subsidiary but has an associate and/or a
 joint venture such an enterprise should also prepare consolidated
 financial statements in accordance with Accounting Standard (AS) 23,
 Accounting for Associates in Consolidated Financial Statements, and
 Accounting Standard (AS) 27, Financial Reporting of Interests in Joint
 Ventures respectively. </em></strong></li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="10"> The consolidated financial statements are prepared on
 the basis of financial statements of parent and all enterprises that
 are controlled by the parent, other than those subsidiaries excluded
 for the reasons set out in paragraph 11. Control exists when the parent
 owns, directly or indirectly through subsidiary(ies), more than
 one-half of the voting power of an enterprise. Control also exists when
 an enterprise controls the composition of the board of directors (in
 the case of a company) or of the corresponding governing body (in case
 of an enterprise not being a company) so as to obtain economic benefits
 from its activities. An enterprise may control the composition of the
 governing bodies of entities such as gratuity trust, provident fund
 trust etc. Since the objective of control over such entities is not to
 obtain economic benefits from their activities, these are not
 considered for the purpose of preparation of consolidated financial
 statements. For the purpose of this Standard, an enterprise is
 considered to control the composition of:</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 56.15pt;"> (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the board
 of directors of a company, if it has the power, without the consent or
 concurrence of any other person, to appoint or remove all or a majority
 of directors of that company. An enterprise is deemed to have the power
 to appoint a director, if any of the following conditions is satisfied:</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 74.15pt;"> (a)&nbsp;&nbsp; a person cannot be
 appointed as director without the exercise in his favour by that
 enterprise of such a power as aforesaid; or</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 74.15pt;"> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp; a person's
 appointment as director follows necessarily from his appointment to a
 position held by him in that enterprise; or</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 74.15pt;"> (c)&nbsp;&nbsp; the director is
 nominated by that enterprise or a subsidiary thereof.</p>
 </div>
 <div style="font-family: Arial;">
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 36.15pt;"> (ii)&nbsp; &nbsp;the governing body
 of an enterprise that is not a company, if it has the power, without
 the consent or the concurrence of any other person, to appoint or
 remove all or a majority of members of the governing body of that other
 enterprise. An enterprise is deemed to have the power to appoint a
 member, if any of the following conditions is satisfied:</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 58.15pt;"> (a)&nbsp;&nbsp; a person cannot be
 appointed as member of the governing body without the exercise in his
 favour by that other enterprise of such a power as aforesaid; or</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 58.15pt;"> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp; a person's
 appointment as member of the governing body follows necessarily from
 his appointment to a position held by him in that other enterprise; or</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 58.15pt;"> (c)&nbsp;&nbsp; the member of the
 governing body is nominated by that other enterprise.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> It is possible that an enterprise is controlled by two enterprises
 - one controls by virtue of ownership of majority of the voting power
 of that enterprise and the other controls, by virtue of an agreement or
 otherwise, the composition of the board of directors so as to obtain
 economic benefits from its activities. In such a rare situation, when
 an enterprise is controlled by two enterprises as per the definition of
 'control', the first mentioned enterprise will be considered as
 subsidiary of both the controlling enterprises within the meaning of
 this Standard and, therefore, both the enterprises need to consolidate
 the financial statements of that enterprise as per the requirements of
 this Standard.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 20pt;"> <strong><em>11.&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>A
 subsidiary should be excluded from consolidation when: </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> <strong><em>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>control
 is intended to be temporary because the subsidiary is acquired and held
 exclusively with a view to its subsequent disposal in the near future;
 or </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> <strong><em>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>it
 operates under severe long-term restrictions which significantly impair
 its ability to transfer funds to the parent. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>In consolidated financial statements, investments in
 such subsidiaries should be accounted for in accordance with Accounting
 Standard (AS) 13, Accounting for Investments. The reasons for not
 consolidating a subsidiary should be disclosed in the consolidated
 financial statements.</em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> <strong><em>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>Where
 an enterprise owns majority of voting power by virtue of ownership of
 the shares of another enterprise and all the shares are held as
 'stock-in-trade' and are acquired and held exclusively with a view to
 their subsequent disposal in the near future, the control by the first
 mentioned enterprise is considered to be temporary within the meaning
 of paragraph 11(a). </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> <strong><em>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>The
 period of time, which is considered as near future for the purposes of
 this Standard primarily depends on the facts and circumstances of each
 case. However, ordinarily, the meaning of the words 'near future' is
 considered as not more than twelve months from acquisition of relevant
 investments unless a longer period can be justified on the basis of
 facts and circumstances of the case. The intention with regard to
 disposal of the relevant investment is considered at the time of
 acquisition of the investment. Accordingly, if the relevant investment
 is acquired without an intention to its subsequent disposal in near
 future, and subsequently, it is decided to dispose off the investment,
 such an investment is not excluded from consolidation, until the
 investment is actually disposed off. Conversely, if the relevant
 investment is acquired with an intention to its subsequent disposal in
 near future, but, due to some valid reasons, it could not be disposed
 off within that period, the same will continue to be excluded from
 consolidation, provided there is no change in the intention. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="12"> Exclusion of a subsidiary from consolidation on the
 ground that its business activities are dissimilar from those of the
 other enterprises within the group is not justified because better
 information is provided by consolidating such subsidiaries and
 disclosing additional information in the consolidated financial
 statements about the different business activities of subsidiaries. For
 example, the disclosures required by Accounting Standard (AS) 17,
 Segment Reporting, help to explain the significance of different
 business activities within the group.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;<br>
 <strong>Consolidation Procedures</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>13. In preparing consolidated financial statements,
 the financial statements of the parent and its subsidiaries should be
 combined on a line by line basis by adding together like items of
 assets, liabilities, income and expenses. In order that the
 consolidated financial statements present financial information about
 the group as that of a single enterprise, the following steps should be
 taken:</em></strong></p>
 </div>
 <div style="font-family: Arial;">
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> <strong><em>(a)&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>the
 cost to the parent of its investment in each subsidiary and the
 parent's portion of equity of each subsidiary, at the date on which
 investment in each subsidiary is made, should be eliminated; </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> <strong><em>(b) </em></strong><strong><em>any
 excess of the cost to the parent of its investment in a subsidiary over
 the parent's portion of equity of the subsidiary, at the date on which
 investment in the subsidiary is made, should be described as goodwill
 to be recognised as an asset in the consolidated financial statements; </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> <strong><em>(c)&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>when
 the cost to the parent of its investment in a subsidiary is less than
 the parent's portion of equity of the subsidiary, at the date on which
 investment in the subsidiary is made, the difference should be treated
 as a capital reserve in the consolidated financial statements; </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> <strong><em>(d) </em></strong><strong><em>minority
 interests in the net income of consolidated subsidiaries for the
 reporting period should be identified and adjusted against the income
 of the group in order to arrive at the net income attributable to the
 owners of the parent; and </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> <strong><em>(e)&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>minority
 interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries should be
 identified and presented in the consolidated balance sheet separately
 from liabilities and the equity of the parent's shareholders. Minority
 interests in the net assets consist of: </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 62pt;"> <strong><em>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>the
 amount of equity attributable to minorities at the date on which
 investment in a subsidiary is made; and </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 62pt;"> <strong><em>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>the
 minorities' share of movements in equity since the date the
 parent-subsidiary relationship came in existence. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>Where the carrying amount of the investment in the
 subsidiary is different from its cost, the carrying amount is
 considered for the purpose of above computations.</em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> <strong><em>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>The
 tax expense (comprising current tax and deferred tax) to be shown in
 the consolidated financial statements should be the aggregate of the
 amounts of tax expense appearing in the separate financial statements
 of the parent and its subsidiaries. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> <strong><em>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>The
 parent's share in the post-acquisition reserves of a subsidiary,
 forming part of the corresponding reserves in the consolidated balance
 sheet, is not required to be disclosed separately in the consolidated
 balance sheet keeping in view the objective of consolidated financial
 statements to present financial information of the group as a whole. In
 view of this, the consolidated reserves disclosed in the consolidated
 balance sheet are inclusive of the parent's share in the
 post-acquisition reserves of a subsidiary. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="14"> The parent's portion of equity in a subsidiary, at
 the date on which investment is made, is determined on the basis of
 information contained in the financial statements of the subsidiary as
 on the date of investment. However, if the financial statements of a
 subsidiary, as on the date of investment, are not available and if it
 is impracticable to draw the financial statements of the subsidiary as
 on that date, financial statements of the subsidiary for the
 immediately preceding period are used as a basis for consolidation.
 Adjustments are made to these financial statements for the effects of
 significant transactions or other events that occur between the date of
 such financial statements and the date of investment in the subsidiary.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="15"> If an enterprise makes two or more investments in
 another enterprise at different dates and eventually obtains control of
 the other enterprise, the consolidated financial statements are
 presented only from the date on which holding-subsidiary relationship
 comes in existence. If two or more investments are made over a period
 of time, the equity of the subsidiary at the date of investment, for
 the purposes of paragraph 13 above, is generally determined on a
 step-by-step basis; however, if small investments are made over a
 period of time and then an investment is made that results in control,
 the date of the latest investment, as a practicable measure, may be
 considered as the date of investment.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="16"> <strong><em>Intragroup balances and intragroup
 transactions and resulting unrealised profits should be eliminated in
 full. Unrealised losses resulting from intragroup transactions should
 also be eliminated unless cost cannot be recovered. </em></strong></li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="17"> Intragroup balances and intragroup transactions,
 including sales, expenses and dividends, are eliminated in full.
 Unrealised profits resulting from intragroup transactions that are
 included in the carrying amount of assets, such as inventory and fixed
 assets, are eliminated in full. Unrealised losses resulting from
 intragroup transactions that are deducted in arriving at the carrying
 amount of assets are also eliminated unless cost cannot be recovered.</li>
 </ol>
 </div>
 <p style="font-family: Arial;"> &nbsp;</p>
 <div style="font-family: Arial;">
 <ol>
 <li value="18"> <strong><em>The financial statements used in the
 consolidation should be drawn up to the same reporting date. If it is
 not practicable to draw up the financial statements of one or more
 subsidiaries to such date and, accordingly, those financial statements
 are drawn up to different reporting dates, adjustments should be made
 for the effects of significant transactions or other events that occur
 between those dates and the date of the parent's financial statements.
 In any case, the difference between reporting dates should not be more
 than six months. </em></strong></li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="19"> The financial statements of the parent and its
 subsidiaries used in the preparation of the consolidated financial
 statements are usually drawn up to the same date. When the reporting
 dates are different, the subsidiary often prepares, for consolidation
 purposes, statements as at the same date as that of the parent. When it
 is impracticable to do this, financial statements drawn up to different
 reporting dates may be used provided the difference in reporting dates
 is not more than six months. The consistency principle requires that
 the length of the reporting periods and any difference in the reporting
 dates should be the same from period to period.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="20"> <strong><em>Consolidated financial statements should
 be prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and
 other events in similar circumstances. If it is not practicable to use
 uniform accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial
 statements, that fact should be disclosed together with the proportions
 of the items in the consolidated financial statements to which the
 different accounting policies have been applied. </em></strong></li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="21"> If a member of the group uses accounting policies
 other than those adopted in the consolidated financial statements for
 like transactions and events in similar circumstances, appropriate
 adjustments are made to its financial statements when they are used in
 preparing the consolidated financial statements.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="22"> The results of operations of a subsidiary are
 included in the consolidated financial statements as from the date on
 which parent-subsidiary relationship came in existence. The results of
 operations of a subsidiary with which parent-subsidiary relationship
 ceases to exist are included in the consolidated statement of profit
 and loss until the date of cessation of the relationship. The
 difference between the proceeds from the disposal of investment in a
 subsidiary and the carrying amount of its assets less liabilities as of
 the date of disposal is recognised in the consolidated statement of
 profit and loss as the profit or loss on the disposal of the investment
 in the subsidiary. In order to ensure the comparability of the
 financial statements from one accounting period to the next,
 supplementary information is often provided about the effect of the
 acquisition and disposal of subsidiaries on the financial position at
 the reporting date and the results for the reporting period and on the
 corresponding amounts for the preceding period.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>

 accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standard (AS) 13, </em></strong></li>

 <p> <strong><em>Accounting for Investments, from the date that the
 enterprise ceases to be a subsidiary and does not become an associate<sup>8</sup>.
 </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="24"> The carrying amount of the investment at the date
 that it ceases to be a subsidiary is regarded as cost thereafter.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="25"> <strong><em>Minority interests should be presented
 in the consolidated balance sheet separately from liabilities and the
 equity of the parent's shareholders. Minority interests in the income
 of the group should also be separately presented. </em></strong></li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="26"> The losses applicable to the minority in a
 consolidated subsidiary may exceed the minority interest in the equity
 of the subsidiary. The excess, and any further losses applicable to the
 minority, are adjusted against the majority interest except to the
 extent that the minority has a binding obligation to, and is able to,
 make good the losses. If the subsidiary subsequently reports profits,
 all such profits are allocated to the majority interest until the
 minority's share of losses previously absorbed by the majority has been
 recovered.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="27"> If a subsidiary has outstanding cumulative preference
 shares which are held outside the group, the parent computes its share
 of profits or losses after adjusting for the subsidiary's preference
 dividends, whether or not dividends have been declared.</li>

 <p> <em>(This Accounting Standard includes paragraphs set in <strong>bold
 italic</strong> type and plain type, which have equal authority.

 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> Pursuant to this Accounting Standard coming into effect, all
 paragraphs of Accounting Standard (AS) 4, Contingencies and Events
 Occurring After the Balance Sheet Date, that deal with contingencies
 (viz., paragraphs 1 (a), 2, 3.1, 4 (4.1 to 4.4), 5 (5.1 to 5.6), 6, 7
 (7.1 to 7.3), 9.1 (relevant portion), 9.2, 10, 11, 12 and 16), stand
 withdrawn except to the extent they deal with impairment of assets not
 covered by other Indian Accounting Standards.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Objective</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> The objective of this Standard is to ensure that appropriate
 recognition criteria and measurement bases are applied to provisions
 and contingent liabilities and that sufficient information is disclosed
 in the notes to the financial statements to enable users to understand
 their nature, timing and amount. The objective of this Standard is also
 to lay down appropriate accounting for contingent assets.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Scope</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>1. This Standard should be applied in accounting for
 provisions and contingent liabilities and in dealing with contingent
 assets, except:</em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 33pt;"> <strong><em>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>those
 resulting from financial instruments<sup>9</sup> that are carried at
 fair value; </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 34pt;"> <strong><em>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>those
 resulting from executory contracts, except where the contract is
 onerous; Explanation : </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 56pt;"> <strong><em>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>An
 'onerous contract' is a contract in which the unavoidable costs of
 meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits
 expected to be received under it. Thus, for a contract to qualify as an
 onerous contract, the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligation under
 the contract should exceed the economic benefits expected to be
 received under it. The unavoidable costs under a contract reflect the
 least net cost of exiting from the contract, which is the lower of the
 cost of fulfilling it and any compensation or penalties arising from
 failure to fulfill it. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 56pt;"> <strong><em>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>If
 an enterprise has a contract that is onerous, the present obligation
 under the contract is recognised and measured as a provision as per
 this Statement. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 56pt;"> <em>The application of the above
 explanation is illustrated in Illustration 10 of Illustration C
 attached to the Standard. </em></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 34pt;"> <strong><em>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>those
 arising in insurance enterprises from contracts with policy-holders;
 and </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 34pt;"> <strong><em>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>those
 covered by another Accounting Standard. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 30pt;"> 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Standard
 applies to financial instruments (including guarantees) that are not
 carried at fair value.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 30pt;"> 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Executory contracts
 are contracts under which neither party has performed any of its
 obligations or both parties have partially performed their obligations
 to an equal extent. This Standard does not apply to executory contracts
 unless they are onerous.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <sup>9</sup>For the purpose of this Standard, the term 'financial
 instruments' shall have the same meaning as in Accounting Standard (AS)
 20, Earnings Per Share</p>
 </div>
 <p style="font-family: Arial;"> &nbsp;</p>
 <div style="font-family: Arial;">
 <ol>
 <li value="4"> This Standard applies to provisions, contingent
 liabilities and contingent assets of insurance enterprises other than
 those arising from contracts with policy-holders.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="5"> Where another Accounting Standard deals with a
 specific type of provision, contingent liability or contingent asset,
 an enterprise applies that Standard instead of this Standard. For
 example, certain types of provisions are also addressed in Accounting
 Standards on:</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> (a)&nbsp;&nbsp; construction contracts
 (see AS 7, Construction Contracts);</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp; taxes on income (see AS
 22, Accounting for Taxes on Income);</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> (c)&nbsp;&nbsp; leases (see AS 19,
 Leases) . However, as AS 19 contains no specific requirements to deal
 with operating leases that have become onerous, this Statement applies
 to such cases; and</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> (d)&nbsp;&nbsp; retirement benefits (see
 AS 15, Accounting for Retirement Benefits in the Financial Statements
 of Employers).</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="6"> Some amounts treated as provisions may relate to the
 recognition of revenue, for example where an enterprise gives
 guarantees in exchange for a fee. This Standard does not address the
 recognition of revenue. AS 9, Revenue Recognition, identifies the
 circumstances in which revenue is recognised and provides practical
 guidance on the application of the recognition criteria. This Standard
 does not change the requirements of AS 9.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="7"> This Standard defines provisions as liabilities which
 can be measured only by using a substantial degree of estimation. The
 term 'provision' is also used in the context of items such as
 depreciation, impairment of assets and doubtful debts: these are
 adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and are not addressed in
 this Standard.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="8"> Other Accounting Standards specify whether
 expenditures are treated as assets or as expenses. These issues are not
 addressed in this Standard. Accordingly, this Standard neither
 prohibits nor requires capitalisation of the costs recognised when a
 provision is made.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="9"> This Standard applies to provisions for restructuring
 (including discontinuing operations). Where a restructuring meets the
 definition of a discontinuing operation, additional disclosures are
 required by AS 24, Discontinuing Operations.</li>

 <p> <strong>Definitions</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>10.&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>The following
 terms are used in this Standard with the meanings specified: </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>10.1 A <u>provision</u> is a liability which can be
 measured only by using a substantial degree of estimation. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>10.2 A <u>liability</u> is a present obligation of
 the enterprise arising from past events, the settlement of which is
 expected to result in an outflow from the enterprise of resources
 embodying economic benefits. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>10.3 An <u>obligating event</u> is an event that
 creates an obligation that results in an enterprise having no realistic
 alternative to settling that obligation.</em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 20pt;"> <strong><em>10.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 </em></strong><strong><em>A <u>contingent liability</u> is: </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> <strong><em>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>a
 possible obligation that arises from past events and the existence of
 which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non occurrence of one
 or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the
 enterprise; or </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> <strong><em>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>a
 present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised
 because: </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 62pt;"> <strong><em>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>it
 is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic
 benefits will be required to settle the obligation; or </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 62pt;"> <strong><em>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>a
 reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation cannot be made. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>10.5 A <u>contingent asset</u> is a possible asset
 that arises from past events the existence of which will be confirmed
 only by the occurrence or nonoccurrence of one or more uncertain future
 events not wholly within the control of the enterprise.</em></strong></p>
 </div>
 <p style="font-family: Arial;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <div style="font-family: Arial;">
 <p> <strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 10.6 <u>Present obligation</u> - an obligation is a present obligation
 if, based on the evidence available, its existence at the balance sheet
 date is considered probable, i.e., more likely than not.</em></strong></p>
 </div>
 <div style="font-family: Arial;">
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>10.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em><u>Possible
 obligation</u></em></strong><strong><em> - an obligation is a possible
 obligation if, based on the evidence available, its existence at the
 balance sheet date is considered not probable. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>10.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>A <u>restructuring</u>
 is a programme that is planned and controlled by management, and
 materially changes either: </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 60pt;"> <strong><em>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>the
 scope of a business undertaken by an enterprise; or </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 60pt;"> <strong><em>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>the
 manner in which that business is conducted. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 11.An obligation is a duty or responsibility to act or perform in a
 certain way. Obligations may be legally enforceable as a consequence of
 a binding contract or statutory requirement. Obligations also arise
 from normal business practice, custom and a desire to maintain good
 business relations or act in an equitable manner.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 12.&nbsp; Provisions can be distinguished from other liabilities
 such as trade payables and accruals because in the measurement of
 provisions substantial degree of estimation is involved with regard to
 the future expenditure required in settlement. By contrast:</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 60pt;"> (a)&nbsp;&nbsp; trade payables are
 liabilities to pay for goods or services that have been received or
 supplied and have been invoiced or formally agreed with the supplier;
 and</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 60pt;"> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp; accruals are liabilities
 to pay for goods or services that have been received or supplied but
 have not been paid, invoiced or formally agreed with the supplier,
 including amounts due to employees. Although it is sometimes necessary
 to estimate the amount of accruals, the degree of estimation is
 generally much less than that for provisions.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 13. In this Standard, the term 'contingent' is used for liabilities
 and assets that are not recognised because their existence will be
 confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more
 uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the
 enterprise. In addition, the term 'contingent liability' is used for
 liabilities that do not meet the recognition criteria.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Recognition</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;<br>
 <strong>Provisions</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 20pt;"> <strong><em>14.&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>A
 provision should be recognised when: </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> <strong><em>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>an
 enterprise has a present obligation as a result of a past event; </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> <strong><em>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>it
 is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits
 will be required to settle the obligation; and </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> <strong><em>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>a
 reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>If these conditions are not met, no provision should
 be recognised.</em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Present Obligation</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 15. In almost all cases it will be clear whether a past event has
 given rise to a present obligation. In rare cases, for example in a
 lawsuit, it may be disputed either whether certain events have occurred
 or whether those events result in a present obligation. In such a case,
 an enterprise determines whether a present obligation exists at the
 balance sheet date by taking account of all available evidence,
 including, for example, the opinion of experts. The evidence considered
 includes any additional evidence provided by events after the balance
 sheet date. On the basis of such evidence:</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> (a)&nbsp; where it is more likely than
 not that a present obligation exists at the balance sheet date, the
 enterprise recognises a provision (if the recognition criteria are
 met); and</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> (b)&nbsp; where it is more likely that
 no present obligation exists at the balance sheet date, the enterprise
 discloses a contingent liability, unless the possibility of an outflow
 of resources embodying economic benefits is remote (see paragraph 68).</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Past Event</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="16"> A past event that leads to a present obligation is
 called an obligating event. For an event to be an obligating event, it
 is necessary that the enterprise has no realistic alternative to
 settling the obligation created by the event.</li>
 </ol>
 </div>
 <p style="font-family: Arial;"> &nbsp;</p>
 <div style="font-family: Arial;">
 <ol>
 <li value="17"> Financial statements deal with the financial position
 of an enterprise at the end of its reporting period and not its
 possible position in the future. Therefore, no provision is recognised
 for costs that need to be incurred to operate in the future. The only
 liabilities recognised in an enterprise's balance sheet are those that
 exist at the balance sheet date.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="18"> It is only those obligations arising from past events
 existing independently of an enterprise's future actions (i.e. the
 future conduct of its business) that are recognised as provisions.
 Examples of such obligations are penalties or clean-up costs for
 unlawful environmental damage, both of which would lead to an outflow
 of resources embodying economic benefits in settlement regardless of
 the future actions of the enterprise. Similarly, an enterprise
 recognises a provision for the decommissioning costs of an oil
 installation to the extent that the enterprise is obliged to rectify
 damage already caused. In contrast, because of commercial pressures or
 legal requirements, an enterprise may intend or need to carry out
 expenditure to operate in a particular way in the future (for example,
 by fitting smoke filters in a certain type of factory). Because the
 enterprise can avoid the future expenditure by its future actions, for
 example by changing its method of operation, it has no present
 obligation for that future expenditure and no provision is recognised.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="19"> An obligation always involves another party to whom
 the obligation is owed. It is not necessary, however, to know the
 identity of the party to whom the obligation is owed - indeed the
 obligation may be to the public at large.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="20"> An event that does not give rise to an obligation
 immediately may do so at a later date, because of changes in the law.
 For example, when environmental damage is caused there may be no
 obligation to remedy the consequences. However, the causing of the
 damage will become an obligating event when a new law requires the
 existing damage to be rectified.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="21"> Where details of a proposed new law have yet to be
 finalised, an obligation arises only when the legislation is virtually
 certain to be enacted. Differences in circumstances surrounding
 enactment usually make it impossible to specify a single event that
 would make the enactment of a law virtually certain. In many cases it
 will be impossible to be virtually certain of the enactment of a law
 until it is enacted.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Probable Outflow of Resources Embodying Economic Benefits</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 22. For a liability to qualify for recognition there must be not
 only a present obligation but also the probability of an outflow of
 resources embodying economic benefits to settle that obligation. For
 the purpose of this Standard<sup>10</sup> , an outflow of resources or
 other event is regarded as probable if the event is more likely than
 not to occur, i.e., the probability that the event will occur is
 greater than the probability that it will not. Where it is not probable
 that a present obligation exists, an enterprise discloses a contingent
 liability, unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying
 economic benefits is remote (see paragraph 68).</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 23. Where there are a number of similar obligations (e.g. product
 warranties or similar contracts) the probability that an outflow will
 be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of
 obligations as a whole. Although the likelihood of outflow for any one
 item may be small, it may well be probable that some outflow of
 resources will be needed to settle the class of obligations as a whole.
 If that is the case, a provision is recognised (if the other
 recognition criteria are met).</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Reliable Estimate of the Obligation</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="24"> The use of estimates is an essential part of the
 preparation of financial statements and does not undermine their
 reliability. This is especially true in the case of provisions, which
 by their nature involve a greater degree of estimation than most other
 items. Except in extremely rare cases, an enterprise will be able to
 determine a range of possible outcomes and can therefore make an
 estimate of the obligation that is reliable to use in recognising a
 provision.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="25"> In the extremely rare case where no reliable estimate
 can be made, a liability exists that cannot be recognised. That
 liability is disclosed as a contingent liability (see paragraph 68).</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Contingent Liabilities</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 20pt;"> <strong><em>26.&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>An
 enterprise should not recognise a contingent liability. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 27.&nbsp; A contingent liability is disclosed, as required by
 paragraph 68, unless the possibility of an outflow of resources
 embodying economic benefits is remote.</p>
 </div>
 <p style="font-family: Arial;"> <sup>10</sup> The interpretation of
 'probable' in this Standard as 'more likely than not' does not
 necessarily apply in other Accounting Standards</p>
 <div style="font-family: Arial;"> &nbsp;</div>
 <p style="font-family: Arial;"> &nbsp;</p>
 <div style="font-family: Arial;">
 <ol>
 <li value="28"> Where an enterprise is jointly and severally liable
 for an obligation, the part of the obligation that is expected to be
 met by other parties is treated as a contingent liability. The
 enterprise recognises a provision for the part of the obligation for
 which an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is probable,
 except in the extremely rare circumstances where no reliable estimate
 can be made (see paragraph 14).</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="29"> Contingent liabilities may develop in a way not
 initially expected. Therefore, they are assessed continually to
 determine whether an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits
 has become probable. If it becomes probable that an outflow of future
 economic benefits will be required for an item previously dealt with as
 a contingent liability, a provision is recognised in accordance with
 paragraph 14 in the financial statements of the period in which the
 change in probability occurs (except in the extremely rare
 circumstances where no reliable estimate can be made).</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Contingent Assets</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 20pt;"> <strong><em>30.&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>An
 enterprise should not recognise a contingent asset. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 31.&nbsp; Contingent assets usually arise from unplanned or other
 unexpected events that give rise to the possibility of an inflow of
 economic benefits to the enterprise. An example is a claim that an
 enterprise is pursuing through legal processes, where the outcome is
 uncertain.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 32.&nbsp; Contingent assets are not recognised in financial
 statements since this may result in the recognition of income that may
 never be realised. However, when the realisation of income is virtually
 certain, then the related asset is not a contingent asset and its
 recognition is appropriate.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 33.&nbsp; A contingent asset is not disclosed in the financial
 statements. It is usually disclosed in the report of the approving
 authority (Board of Directors in the case of a company, and, the
 corresponding approving authority in the case of any other enterprise),
 where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 34.&nbsp; Contingent assets are assessed continually and if it has
 become virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits will
 arise, the asset and the related income are recognised in the financial
 statements of the period in which the change occurs.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;<br>
 <strong>Measurement</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;<strong>Best Estimate</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="35"> <strong><em>The amount recognised as a provision
 should be the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the
 present obligation at the balance sheet date. The amount of a provision
 should not be discounted to its present value except in case of
 decommissioning, restoration and similar liabilities that are
 recognised as cost of Property, Plant and Equipment. The discount rate
 (or rates) should be a pre-tax rate (or rates) that reflect(s) current
 market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to
 the liability. The discount rate(s) should not reflect risks for which
 future cash flow estimates have been adjusted. Periodic unwinding of
 discount should be recognised in the statement of profit and loss. </em></strong></li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="36"> The estimates of outcome and financial effect are
 determined by the judgment of the management of the enterprise,
 supplemented by experience of similar transactions and, in some cases,
 reports from independent experts. The evidence considered includes any
 additional evidence provided by events after the balance sheet date.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="37"> The provision is measured before tax; the tax
 consequences of the provision, and changes in it, are dealt with under
 AS 22, Accounting for Taxes on Income.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Risks and Uncertainties</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="38"> <strong><em>The risks and uncertainties that
 inevitably surround many events and circumstances should be taken into
 account in reaching the best estimate of a provision. </em></strong></li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="39"> Risk describes variability of outcome. A risk
 adjustment may increase the amount at which a liability is measured.
 Caution is needed in making judgments under conditions of uncertainty,
 so that income or assets are not overstated and expenses or liabilities
 are not understated. However, uncertainty does not justify the creation
 of excessive provisions or a deliberate overstatement of liabilities.
 For example, if the projected costs of a particularly adverse outcome
 are estimated on a prudent basis, that outcome is not then deliberately
 treated as more probable than is realistically the case. Care is needed
 to avoid duplicating adjustments for risk and uncertainty with
 consequent overstatement of a provision.</li>
 </ol>
 </div>
 <p style="font-family: Arial;"> <br>
 40.&nbsp; Disclosure of the uncertainties surrounding the amount of the
 expenditure is made under paragraph 67(b).</p>
 <div style="font-family: Arial;">
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Future Events</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="41"> <strong><em>Future events that may affect the amount
 required to settle an obligation should be reflected in the amount of a
 provision where there is sufficient objective evidence that they will
 occur. </em></strong></li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="42"> Expected future events may be particularly important
 in measuring provisions. For example, an enterprise may believe that
 the cost of cleaning up a site at the end of its life will be reduced
 by future changes in technology. The amount recognised reflects a
 reasonable expectation of technically qualified, objective observers,
 taking account of all available evidence as to the technology that will
 be available at the time of the clean-up. Thus, it is appropriate to
 include, for example, expected cost reductions associated with
 increased experience in applying existing technology or the expected
 cost of applying existing technology to a larger or more complex
 clean-up operation than has previously been carried out. However, an
 enterprise does not anticipate the development of a completely new
 technology for cleaning up unless it is supported by sufficient
 objective evidence.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 43. The effect of possible new legislation is taken into
 consideration in measuring an existing obligation when sufficient
 objective evidence exists that the legislation is virtually certain to
 be enacted. The variety of circumstances that arise in practice usually
 makes it impossible to specify a single event that will provide
 sufficient, objective evidence in every case. Evidence is required both
 of what legislation will demand and of whether it is virtually certain
 to be enacted and implemented in due course. In many cases sufficient
 objective evidence will not exist until the new legislation is enacted.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Expected Disposal of Assets</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="44"> <strong><em>Gains from the expected disposal of
 assets should not be taken into account in measuring a provision. </em></strong></li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="45"> Gains on the expected disposal of assets are not
 taken into account in measuring a provision, even if the expected
 disposal is closely linked to the event giving rise to the provision.
 Instead, an enterprise recognises gains on expected disposals of assets
 at the time specified by the Accounting Standard dealing with the
 assets concerned.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Reimbursements</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="46"> <strong><em>Where some or all of the expenditure
 required to settle a provision is expected to be reimbursed by another
 party, the reimbursement should be recognised when, and only when, it
 is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received if the
 enterprise settles the obligation. The reimbursement should be treated
 as a separate asset. The amount recognised for the reimbursement should
 not exceed the amount of the provision. </em></strong></li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="47"> <strong><em>In the statement of profit and loss, the
 expense relating to a provision may be presented net of the amount
 recognised for a reimbursement. </em></strong></li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="48"> Sometimes, an enterprise is able to look to another
 party to pay part or all of the expenditure required to settle a
 provision (for example, through insurance contracts, indemnity clauses
 or suppliers' warranties). The other party may either reimburse amounts
 paid by the enterprise or pay the amounts directly.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="49"> In most cases, the enterprise will remain liable for
 the whole of the amount in question so that the enterprise would have
 to settle the full amount if the third party failed to pay for any
 reason. In this situation, a provision is recognised for the full
 amount of the liability, and a separate asset for the expected
 reimbursement is recognised when it is virtually certain that
 reimbursement will be received if the enterprise settles the liability.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="50"> In some cases, the enterprise will not be liable for
 the costs in question if the third party fails to pay. In such a case,
 the enterprise has no liability for those costs and they are not
 included in the provision.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 51. As noted in paragraph 28, an obligation for which an enterprise
 is jointly and severally liable is a contingent liability to the extent
 that it is expected that the obligation will be settled by the other
 parties.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Changes in Provisions</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>52. </em></strong><strong><em>Provisions should be
 reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current
 best estimate. If it is no longer probable that an outflow of resources
 embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation,
 the provision should be reversed. </em></strong></p>
 </div>
 <p style="font-family: Arial;"> &nbsp;</p>
 <div style="font-family: Arial;">
 <p> <strong>Use of Provisions</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="53"> <strong><em>A provision should be used only for
 expenditures for which the provision was originally recognised. </em></strong></li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="54"> Only expenditures that relate to the original
 provision are adjusted against it. Adjusting expenditures against a
 provision that was originally recognised for another purpose would
 conceal the impact of two different events.</li>

 <p> <strong>Application of the Recognition and Measurement Rules</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Future Operating Losses</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 20pt;"> <strong><em>55.&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>Provisions
 should not be recognised for future operating losses. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 56.&nbsp; Future operating losses do not meet the definition of a
 liability in paragraph 10 and the general recognition criteria set out
 for provisions in paragraph 14.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 57.&nbsp; An expectation of future operating losses is an
 indication that certain assets of the operation may be impaired. An
 enterprise tests these assets for impairment under Accounting Standard
 (AS) 28, Impairment of Assets.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Restructuring</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 20pt;"> 58.&nbsp;&nbsp; The following are
 examples of events that may fall under the definition of restructuring:</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> (a)&nbsp;&nbsp; sale or termination of a
 line of business;</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp; the closure of business
 locations in a country or region or the relocation of business
 activities from one country or region to another;</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> (c)&nbsp;&nbsp; changes in management
 structure, for example, eliminating a layer of management; and</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> (d)&nbsp;&nbsp; fundamental
 re-organisations that have a material effect on the nature and focus of
 the enterprise's operations.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 59.&nbsp; A provision for restructuring costs is recognised only
 when the recognition criteria for provisions set out in paragraph 14
 are met.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>60.&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>No obligation
 arises for the sale of an operation until the enterprise is committed
 to the sale, i.e., there is a binding sale agreement. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> 61.&nbsp; An enterprise cannot be committed to the sale until a
 purchaser has been identified and there is a binding sale agreement.
 Until there is a binding sale agreement, the enterprise will be able to
 change its mind and indeed will have to take another course of action
 if a purchaser cannot be found on acceptable terms. When the sale of an
 operation is envisaged as part of a restructuring, the assets of the
 operation are reviewed for impairment under Accounting Standard (AS)
 28, Impairment of Assets.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong><em>62.&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>A restructuring
 provision should include only the direct expenditures arising from the
 restructuring, which are those that are both: </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> <strong><em>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>necessarily
 entailed by the restructuring; and </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> <strong><em>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>not
 associated with the ongoing activities of the enterprise. </em></strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 20pt;"> 63.&nbsp;&nbsp; A restructuring
 provision does not include such costs as:</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> (a)&nbsp;&nbsp; retraining or relocating
 continuing staff;</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp; marketing; or</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 40pt;"> (c)&nbsp;&nbsp; investment in new
 systems and distribution networks.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> These expenditures relate to the future conduct of the business and
 are not liabilities for restructuring at the balance sheet date. Such
 expenditures are recognised on the same basis as if they arose
 independently of a restructuring.</p>
 </div>
 <p style="font-family: Arial;"> &nbsp;</p>
 <div style="font-family: Arial;">
 <ol>
 <li value="64"> Identifiable future operating losses up to the date
 of a restructuring are not included in a provision.</li>
 </ol>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <ol>
 <li value="65"> As required by paragraph 44, gains on the expected
 disposal of assets are not taken into account in measuring a
 restructuring provision, even if the sale of assets is envisaged as
 part of the restructuring.</li>

 as a single class of provision amounts relating to warranties of

 <p style="margin-left: 10pt;"> <strong>Illustration 1: Warranties</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 10pt;"> A manufacturer gives warranties at the
 time of sale to purchasers of its product. Under the terms of the
 contract for sale the manufacturer undertakes to make good, by repair
 or replacement, manufacturing defects that become apparent within three
 years from the date of sale. On past experience, it is probable (i.e.
 more likely than not) that there will be some claims under the
 warranties.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 10pt;"> <strong>Present obligation as a result
 of a past obligating event -</strong>The obligating event is the sale
 of the product with a warranty, which gives rise to an obligation.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 10pt;"> <strong>An outflow of resources
 embodying economic benefits in settlement - </strong>Probable for the
 warranties as a whole (see paragraph 23).</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 10pt;"> <strong>Conclusion - </strong>A
 provision is recognised for the best estimate of the costs of making
 good under the warranty products sold before the balance sheet date
 (see paragraphs 14 and 23).</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 10pt;"> <strong>Illustration 2: Contaminated
 Land -Legislation Virtually Certain to be Enacted</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 10pt;"> An enterprise in the oil industry causes
 contamination but does not clean up because there is no legislation
 requiring cleaning up, and the enterprise has been contaminating land
 for several years. At 31 March 2005 it is virtually certain that a law
 requiring a clean-up of land already contaminated will be enacted
 shortly after the year end.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 10pt;"> <strong>Present obligation as a result
 of a past obligating event -</strong>The obligating event is the
 contamination of the land because of the virtual certainty of
 legislation requiring cleaning up.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 10pt;"> <strong>An outflow of resources
 embodying economic benefits in settlement - </strong>Probable.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 10pt;"> <strong>Conclusion - </strong>A
 provision is recognised for the best estimate of the costs of the
 clean-up (see paragraphs 14 and 21).</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 10pt;"> <strong>Illustration 3: Offshore Oil
 field</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 10pt;"> An enterprise operates an offshore oil
 field where its licensing agreement requires it to remove the oil rig
 at the end of production and restore the seabed. Ninety per cent of the
 eventual costs relate to the removal of the oil rig and restoration of
 damage caused by building it, and ten per cent arise through the
 extraction of oil. At the balance sheet date, the rig has been
 constructed but no oil has been extracted.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Present obligation as a result of a past obligating event -</strong>The
 construction of the oil rig creates an obligation under the terms of
 the licence to remove the rig and restore the seabed and is thus an
 obligating event. At the balance sheet date, however, there is no
 obligation to rectify the damage that will be caused by extraction of
 the oil.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>An outflow of resources embodying economic benefits in
 settlement -&nbsp; </strong>Probable for the warranties as a whole
 (see Paragraph 23).</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Conclusion -</strong>A provision is recognised for the
 best estimate of ninety per cent of the eventual costs that relate to
 the removal of the oil rig and restoration of damage caused by building
 it (see paragraph 14). These costs are included as part of the cost of
 the oil rig. The ten per cent of costs that arise through the
 extraction of oil are recognised as a liability when the oil is
 extracted.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Illustration 4: Refunds Policy</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> A retail store has a policy of refunding purchases by dissatisfied
 customers, even though it is under no legal obligation to do so. Its
 policy of making refunds is generally known.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Present obligation as a result of a past obligating event -</strong>The
 obligating event is the sale of the product, which gives rise to an
 obligation because obligations also arise from normal business
 practice, custom and a desire to maintain good business relations or
 act in an equitable manner.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>An outflow of resources embodying economic benefits in
 settlement</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> Probable, a proportion of goods are returned for refund (see
 paragraph 23).</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Conclusion - </strong>A provision is recognised for the
 best estimate of the costs of refunds (see paragraphs 11, 14 and 23).</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Illustration 5: Legal Requirement to Fit Smoke Filters</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> Under new legislation, an enterprise is required to fit smoke
 filters to its factories by 30 September 2005. The enterprise has not
 fitted the smoke filters.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 20pt;"> (a)&nbsp; At the balance sheet date of
 31 March 2005</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Present obligation as a result of a past obligating event -</strong>There
 is no obligation because there is no obligating event either for the
 costs of fitting smoke filters or for fines under the legislation.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Conclusion - </strong>No provision is recognised for the
 cost of fitting the smoke filters (see paragraphs 14 and 16-18).</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 20pt;"> (b)&nbsp; At the balance sheet date of
 31 March 2006</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Present obligation as a result of a past obligating event -</strong>There
 is still no obligation for the costs of fitting smoke filters because
 no obligating event has occurred (the fitting of the filters). However,
 an obligation might arise to pay fines or penalties under the
 legislation because the obligating event has occurred (the
 non-compliant operation of the factory).</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>An outflow of resources embodying economic benefits in
 settlement - </strong>Assessment of probability of incurring fines and
 penalties by non-compliant operation depends on the details of the
 legislation and the stringency of the enforcement regime.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Conclusion - </strong>No provision is recognised for the
 costs of fitting smoke filters. However, a provision is recognised for
 the best estimate of any fines and penalties that are more likely than
 not to be imposed (see paragraphs 14 and 16-18).</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Illustration 6: Staff Retraining as a Result of Changes in
 the Income Tax System</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> The government introduces a number of changes to the income tax
 system. As a result of these changes, an enterprise in the financial
 services sector will need to retrain a large proportion of its
 administrative and sales work force in order to ensure continued
 compliance with financial services regulation. At the balance sheet
 date, no retraining of staff has taken place.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Present obligation as a result of a past obligating event -</strong>There
 is no obligation because no obligating event (retraining) has taken
 place.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Conclusion - </strong>No provision is recognised (see
 paragraphs 14 and 16-18).</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Illustration&nbsp; 7: A Single Guarantee</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> During 2004-05, Enterprise A gives a guarantee of certain
 borrowings of Enterprise B, whose financial condition at that time is
 sound. During 2005-06, the financial condition of Enterprise B
 deteriorates and at 30 September 2005 Enterprise B goes into
 liquidation.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> (a) At 31 March 2005</p>
 </div>
 <p style="font-family: Arial;"> &nbsp;</p>
 <div style="font-family: Arial;">
 <p> <strong>Present obligation as a result of a past obligating event -</strong>The
 obligating event is the giving of the guarantee, which gives rise to an
 obligation.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>An outflow of resources embodying economic benefits in
 settlement</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> No outflow of benefits is probable at 31 March 2005.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Conclusion -</strong>No provision is recognised (see
 paragraphs 14 and 22). The guarantee is disclosed as a contingent
 liability unless the probability of any outflow is regarded as remote
 (see paragraph 68).</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> (b) At 31 March 2006</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Present obligation as a result of a past obligating event </strong>-The
 obligating event is the giving of the guarantee, which gives rise to a
 legal obligation.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>An outflow of resources embodying economic benefits in
 settlement - </strong>At 31 March 2006, it is probable that an outflow
 of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the
 obligation.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Conclusion -</strong>A provision is recognised for the
 best estimate of the obligation (see paragraphs 14 and 22).</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> Note: This example deals with a single guarantee. If an enterprise
 has a portfolio of similar guarantees, it will assess that portfolio as
 a whole in determining whether an outflow of resources embodying
 economic benefit is probable (see paragraph 23). Where an enterprise
 gives guarantees in exchange for a fee, revenue is recognised under AS
 9, Revenue Recognition.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Illustration 8: A Court Case</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> After a wedding in 2004-05, ten people died, possibly as a result
 of food poisoning from products sold by the enterprise. Legal
 proceedings are started seeking damages from the enterprise but it
 disputes liability. Up to the date of approval of the financial
 statements for the year 31 March 2005, the enterprise's lawyers advise
 that it is probable that the enterprise will not be found liable.
 However, when the enterprise prepares the financial statements for the
 year 31 March 2006, its lawyers advise that, owing to developments in
 the case, it is probable that the enterprise will be found liable.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 20pt;"> (a)&nbsp; At 31 March 2005</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Present obligation as a result of a past obligating event -</strong>On
 the basis of the evidence available when the financial statements were
 approved, there is no present obligation as a result of past events.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Conclusion - </strong>No provision is recognised (see
 definition of 'present obligation' and paragraph 15). The matter is
 disclosed as a contingent liability unless the probability of any
 outflow is regarded as remote (paragraph 68).</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 20pt;"> (b)&nbsp; At 31 March 2006</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Present obligation as a result of a past obligating event -</strong>On
 the basis of the evidence available, there is a present obligation.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>An outflow of resources embodying economic benefits in
 settlement - </strong>Probable.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Conclusion - </strong>A provision is recognised for the
 best estimate of the amount to settle the obligation (paragraphs 14-15).</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Illustration 9A: Refurbishment Costs -No Legislative
 Requirement</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> A furnace has a lining that needs to be replaced every five years
 for technical reasons. At the balance sheet date, the lining has been
 in use for three years.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Present obligation as a result of a past obligating event -</strong>There
 is no present obligation.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Conclusion - </strong>No provision is recognised (see
 paragraphs 14 and 16-18).</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> The cost of replacing the lining is not recognised because, at the
 balance sheet date, no obligation to replace the lining exists
 independently of the company's future actions - even the intention to
 incur the expenditure depends on the company deciding to continue
 operating the furnace or to replace the lining.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Illustration 9B: Refurbishment Costs -Legislative
 Requirement</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> An airline is required by law to overhaul its aircraft once every
 three years.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Present obligation as a result of a past obligating event -</strong>There
 is no present obligation.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> <strong>Conclusion - </strong>No provision is recognised (see
 paragraphs 14 and 16-18).</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p> The costs of overhauling aircraft are not recognised as a provision
 for the same reasons as the cost of replacing the lining is not
 recognised as a provision in illustration 9A. Even a legal requirement
 to overhaul does not make the costs of overhaul a liability, because no
 obligation exists to overhaul the aircraft independently of the
 enterprise's future actions - the enterprise could avoid the future
 expenditure by its future actions, for example by selling the aircraft.</p>

 <p style="margin-left: 9pt;"> <strong>Illustration 10: An onerous
 contract</strong></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 9pt;"> An enterprise operates profitably from a
 factory that it has leased under an operating lease. During December
 2005 the enterprise relocates its operations to a new factory. The
 lease on the old factory continues for the next four years, it cannot
 be cancelled and the factory cannot be re-let to another user.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 9pt;"> <strong>Present obligation as a result
 of a past obligating event -</strong>The obligating event occurs when
 the lease contract becomes binding on the enterprise, which gives rise
 to a legal obligation.</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 9pt;"> <strong>An outflow of resources
 embodying economic benefits in settlement - </strong>When the lease
 becomes onerous, an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is
 probable. (Until the lease becomes onerous, the enterprise accounts for
 the lease under AS 19, Leases).</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 9pt;"> <strong>Conclusion -</strong>A provision
 is recognised for the best estimate of the unavoidable lease payments.</p>

 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 9pt;"> <strong>Illustration 1 Warranties</strong></p>
 <p style="margin-left: 9pt;"> A manufacturer gives warranties at the
 time of sale to purchasers of its three product lines. Under the terms
 of the warranty, the manufacturer undertakes to repair or replace items
 that fail to perform satisfactorily for two years from the date of
 sale. At the balance sheet date, a provision of Rs. 60,000 has been
 recognised. The following information is disclosed:</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 9pt;"> <em>A provision of Rs. 60,000 has been
 recognised for expected warranty claims on products sold during the
 last three financial years. It is expected that the majority of this
 expenditure will be incurred in the next financial year, and all will
 be incurred within two years of the balance sheet date.</em></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 9pt;"> <em>An illustration is given below of
 the disclosures required by paragraph 72 where some of the information
 required is not given because it can be expected to prejudice seriously
 the position of the enterprise.</em></p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 9pt;"> <strong>Illustration 2 Disclosure
 Exemption</strong></p>
 <p style="margin-left: 9pt;"> An enterprise is involved in a dispute
 with a competitor, who is alleging that the enterprise has infringed
 patents and is seeking damages of Rs. 1000 lakhs. The enterprise
 recognises a provision for its best estimate of the obligation, but
 discloses none of the information required by paragraphs 66 and 67 of
 the Standard. The following information is disclosed:</p>
 <p> &nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 9pt;"> <em>Litigation is in process against the
 company relating to a dispute with a competitor who alleges that the
 company has infringed patents and is seeking damages of Rs. 1000 lakhs.
 The information usually required by AS 29, Provisions, Contingent
 Liabilities and Contingent Assets is not disclosed on the grounds that
 it can be expected to prejudice the interests of the company. The
 directors are of the opinion that the claim can be successfully
 resisted by the company.</em></p>
