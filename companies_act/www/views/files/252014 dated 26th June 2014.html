 Clarification on
 applicability of requirement for resident director.</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"
  style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial;">Sir,</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"
  style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial;">Section
 149(3) of the
 Companies
 Act, 2013 (Act) requires every company to have at least one director
 who has
 stayed in India for a total period of not less than 182 days in the
 previous
 calendar year. Government has received requests from stakeholders for
 clarification with regard to applicability of these provisions in the
 current
 calendar/financial year.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"
  style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial;">2. The
 matter has
 been examined.
 It is clarified that the 'residency requirement' would be reckoned from
 the
 date of commencement of section 149 of the Act i.e. 1st April, 2014.
 The first
 'previous calendar year' for compliance with these provisions would,
 therefore,
 be Calendar Year 2014. The period to be taken into account for
 compliance with
 these provisions will be the remaining period of calendar year 2014
 (i.e. 1*
 April to 31st December). Therefore, on a proportionate basis, the
 number of
 days for which the director(s) would need to be resident in India,
 during Calendar
 Year 2014, shall exceed 136 days.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"
  style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial;">3.
 Regarding newly
 incorporated
 companies it is clarified that companies incorporated between 1.4.2014
 to
 30.9.2014 should have a resident director either at the incorporation
 stage
 itself or within six months of their incorporation. Companies
 incorporated
 after 30.9.2014 need to have the resident director from the date of
 incorporation itself.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"
  style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial;">This issues
  with the
 approval of
 t he competent authority.</p>
