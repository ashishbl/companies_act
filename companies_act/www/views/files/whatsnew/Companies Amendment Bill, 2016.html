<p align="center">STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS
</p>
<p>
The Companies Act, 2013 (the Act) was enacted to consolidate and amend
the Laws relating to companies. Out of 470 sections of the Act, 284
sections
have been brought into force so far. The process for establishment of
the National Company Law Tribunal and National Company Law Appellate
Tribunal is
at its final stage. After the constitution of these Tribunals, most of
the remaining 186 sections of the Act shall also be brought into force.
</p>
<p>
2. The Act introduced significant changes related to disclosures to
stakeholders, accountability of directors, auditors and key managerial
personnel,
investor protection and corporate governance. However, Government
received number of representations from industry Chambers, Professional
Institutes,
legal experts and Ministries/Departments regarding difficulties faced
in compliance of certain provisions. Amendments of the Act were carried
out
through the Companies (Amendment) Act, 2015 to address the immediate
difficulties arising out of the initial experience of the working of
the Act, and
to facilitate "ease of doing business". During the consideration of the
Companies (Amendment) Bill, 2015 in the Rajya Sabha, views were
expressed that
more amendments would be required. A Companies Law Committee (the
Committee) was, therefore, constituted consisting of representatives
from the
industry, professional institutes of chartered accountants, cost
accountants and company secretaries, and a former High Court Judge
under the
chairmanship of Secretary, Ministry of Corporate Affairs, to examine
the need for further amendments.
</p>
<p>
3. The Committee had invited suggestions from all stakeholders and
thereafter held broad based consultations on the suggestions received.
The Committee
submitted its report to the Government on the 1st February, 2016 which
was put in public domain for comments. Based on the report and comments
received
from the stakeholders and Ministries/ Departments, it has been decided
to amend the Companies Act, 2013.
</p>
<p>
4. The proposed changes are broadly aimed at addressing difficulties in
implementation owing to stringency of compliance requirements;
facilitating
ease of doing business in order to promote growth with employment;
harmonisation with accounting standards, the Securities and Exchange
Board of India
Act, 1992 and the regulations made thereunder, and the Reserve Bank of
India Act, 1934 and the regulations made thereunder; rectifying
omissions and
inconsistencies in the Act, and carrying out amendments in the
provisions relating to qualifications and selection of members of the
National Company
Law Tribunal and the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal in
accordance with the directions of the Supreme Court.
</p>
<p>
5. The Companies (Amendment) Bill, 2016, <em>inter alia</em>,
proposes the following, namely:-
</p>
<p>
(<em>a</em>) simplification of the private placement
process by doing away with separate offer letter, by making filing of
details or records of
applicants to be part of return of allotment only, and reducing number
of filings to Registrar;
</p>
<p>
(<em>b</em>) allow unrestricted object clause in the
Memorandum of Association dispensing with detailed listing of objects,
self-declarations to
replace affidavits from subscribers to memorandum and first directors;
</p>
<p>
(<em>c</em>) provisions relating to forward dealing and
insider trading to be omitted from the Act;
</p>
<p>
(<em>d</em>) requirement of approval of the Central
Government for Managerial remuneration above prescribed limits to be
replaced by approval through
special resolution by shareholders;
</p>
<p>
(<em>e</em>) a company may give loans to entities in which
directors are interested after passing special resolution and adhering
to disclosure
requirement;
</p>
<p>
(<em>f</em>) remove restrictions on layers of subsidiaries
and investment companies;
</p>
<p>
(<em>g</em>) allow for exempting class of foreign companies
from registering and compliance regime under the Act;
</p>
<p>
(<em>h</em>) align prescription for companies to have Audit
Committee and Nomination and Remuneration Committee with that of
Independent Directors;
</p>
<p>
(<em>i</em>) test of materiality to be introduced for
pecuniary interest for testing independence of Independent Directors;
</p>
<p>
(<em>j</em>) disclosures in the prospectus required under
the Companies Act and the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act,
1992 and the
regulations made thereunder to be aligned by omitting prescriptions in
the Companies Act and allowing these prescriptions to be made by the
Securities
and Exchange Board of India in consultation with the Central
Government;
</p>
<p>
(<em>k</em>) provide for maintenance of register of
significant beneficial owners by a company, and filing of returns in
this regard to the Registrar;
</p>
<p>
(<em>l</em>) removal of requirement for annual ratification
of appointment or continuance of auditor;
</p>
<p>
