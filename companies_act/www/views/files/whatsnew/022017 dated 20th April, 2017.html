        Subject: Clarification regarding online generation of challans for
        offline payment cases.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Sir/madam,
</p>
<p>
    In terms of Investors Education and Protection Fund (Accounting, Audit,
    Transfer and Refund) Rules, 2016 as notified on 05.09.2016, and as per the
    prerequisites of e-form IEPF-1, the companies are required to transfer the
    amounts to Investor Education and Protection Fund(IEPF) through challans
    generated on MCA 21 portal. Attention is also drawn to Circular no. 13/2016
    dated 05.12.2016 issued by this office, communicating that challans which
    are not generated on MCA 21 portal will not be accepted after 15.12.2016.
</p>
<p>
    2. However it has been noticed that there are companies, which have
    transferred the amount to IEPF prior to 15.12.2016, through challans not
    generated on MCA-21 portal and these companies were/are unable to file
    IEPF-1.
</p>
<p>
    3. to facilitate filing of e-form IEPF-1 by such companies, following two
    step process is suggested:-
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Step -I</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Company concerned is required to submit details of challans in prescribed
format (enclosed) to IEPF Authority on email ID    <a href="mailto:challan.iepfa@mca.gov.in">Challan.iepfa@mca.gov.in</a>. The
    copy of challans and certificate for authentication of the details
    submitted are required to be obtained from practicing professionals 'viz.
    Chartered Accountant, Company Secretaries and cost Accountants. This
    information will be accepted by IEPF Authority up to 20<sup>th</sup> May,
    2017 only and no further relaxation shall be granted.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Step II</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The submitted data shall be processed by IEPF authority and Front Office
Service will be made available on IEPF website www. iepf.gov.in from 5    <sup>th</sup> June, 2017 for a period of 30 days i.e. up to 5<sup>th</sup>
    July, 2017 to enable the companies to submit the required data online. An
    automated generated number will be provided by the MCA21 system on
    validation of entries and using this automated generated number as SRN,
    companies may file e-form IEPF-1 online and upload investor details without
    requirement of filing additional fees.
</p>
<p>
    4. This issues with the approval of the competent Authority.
