<p> <strong>Objective</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> The objective of this Standard is to prescribe the accounting
treatment of revenue and costs associated with construction contracts.
Because of the nature of the activity undertaken in construction
contracts, the date at which the contract activity is entered into and
the date when the activity is completed usually fall into different
accounting periods. Therefore, the primary issue in accounting for
construction contracts is the allocation of contract revenue and
contract costs to the accounting periods in which construction work is
performed. This Standard uses the recognition criteria established in
the&nbsp;<em>Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of
Financial Statements</em>&nbsp;issued by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of India to determine when contract revenue and contract
costs should be recognised as revenue and expenses in the statement of
profit and loss. It also provides practical guidance on the application
of these criteria.</p>

<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;"> <strong>A&nbsp;<em>fixed price

agrees to a fixed contract price, or a fixed rate per unit of output,
which in some cases is subject to cost escalation clauses.</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;"> <strong>A&nbsp;<em>cost plus contract</em>&nbsp;is
a construction contract in which the contractor is reimbursed for

4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A construction contract may be negotiated for the construction of a
single asset such as a bridge, building, dam, pipeline, road, ship or
tunnel. A construction contract may also deal with the construction of
a number of assets which are closely interrelated or interdependent in
terms of their design, technology and function or their ultimate
purpose or use; examples of such contracts include those for the
construction of refineries and other complex pieces of plant or
equipment.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For the purposes of this Standard, construction contracts include:</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 66.45pt;">
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contracts for the
rendering of services which are directly related to the construction of
the asset, for example, those for the services of project managers and
architects; and</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 66.45pt;">
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contracts for the
destruction or restoration of assets, and the restoration of the
environment following the demolition of assets.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Construction contracts are formulated in a number of ways which, for
the purposes of this Standard, are classified as fixed price contracts
and cost plus contracts. Some construction contracts may contain
characteristics of both a fixed price contract and a cost plus
contract, for example in the case of a cost plus contract with an
agreed maximum price. In such circumstances, a contractor needs to
consider all the conditions in paragraphs 23 and 24 in order to
determine when to recognise contract revenue and expenses.</p>

7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The requirements of this Standard are usually applied separately to
each construction contract. However, in certain circumstances, it is
necessary to apply the Standard to the separately identifiable
components of a single contract or to a group of contracts together in
order to reflect the substance of a contract or a group of contracts.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 60.45pt;"> <strong>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>the

<p> <strong>Contract revenue</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;"> <strong>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>Contract
revenue shall comprise:</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 58.45pt;"> <strong>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>the
initial amount of revenue agreed in the contract; and</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 58.45pt;"> <strong>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>variations
in contract work, claims and incentive payments:</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 94.45pt;"> <strong>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>to
the extent that it is probable that they will result in revenue; and</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 94.45pt;"> <strong>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>they
are capable of being reliably measured.</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contract
revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or
receivable. The measurement of contract revenue is affected by a
variety of uncertainties that depend on the outcome of future events.
The estimates often need to be revised as events occur and
uncertainties are resolved. Therefore, the amount of contract revenue
may increase or decrease from one period to the next. For example:</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60.45pt;"> (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a
contractor and a customer may agree variations or claims that increase
or decrease contract revenue in a period subsequent to that in which
the contract was initially agreed;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60.45pt;"> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the
amount of revenue agreed in a fixed price contract may increase as a
result of cost escalation clauses;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60.45pt;"> (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the
amount of contract revenue may decrease as a result of penalties
arising from delays caused by the contractor in the completion of the
contract; or</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 62.45pt;"> (d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when a fixed
price contract involves a fixed price per unit of output, contract
revenue increases as the number of units is increased.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A variation
is an instruction by the customer for a change in the scope of the work
to be performed under the contract. A variation may lead to an increase
or a decrease in contract revenue. Examples of variations are changes
in the specifications or design of the asset and changes in the
duration of the contract. A variation is included in contract revenue
when:</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60.45pt;"> (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it is
probable that the customer will approve the variation and the amount of
revenue arising from the variation; and</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60.45pt;"> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the
amount of revenue can be reliably measured.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A claim is an
amount that the contractor seeks to collect from the customer or
another party as reimbursement for costs not included in the contract
price. A claim may arise from, for example, customer caused delays,
errors in specifications or design, and disputed variations in contract
work. The measurement of the amounts of revenue arising from claims is
subject to a high level of uncertainty and often depends on the outcome
of negotiations. Therefore, claims are included in contract revenue
only when:</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60.45pt;"> (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
negotiations have reached an advanced stage such that it is probable
that the customer will accept the claim; and</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60.45pt;"> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the
amount that it is probable will be accepted by the customer can be
measured reliably.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Incentive
payments are additional amounts paid to the contractor if specified
performance standards are met or exceeded. For example, a contract may
allow for an incentive payment to the contractor for early completion
of the contract. Incentive payments are included in contract revenue
when:</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 64.45pt;">
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the contract is sufficiently
advanced that it is probable that the specified performance standards
will be met or exceeded; and</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 64.45pt;">
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the amount of the incentive
payment can be measured reliably.</p>

<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Costs that
relate directly to a specific contract include:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 57.45pt;"> (h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; claims from
third parties.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;"> These costs may be reduced by any
incidental income that is not included in contract revenue, for example
income from the sale of surplus materials and the disposal of plant and
equipment at the end of the contract.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Costs that
may be attributable to contract activity in general and can be
allocated to specific contracts include:</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 58.45pt;"> (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; insurance;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 58.45pt;"> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; costs of design

contract; and</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 58.45pt;"> (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; construction
overheads.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;"> Such costs are allocated using
methods that are systematic and rational and are applied consistently
to all costs having similar characteristics. The allocation is based on
the normal level of construction activity. Construction overheads
include costs such as the preparation and processing of construction
personnel payroll. Costs that may be attributable to contract activity
in general and can be allocated to specific contracts also include
borrowing costs.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
19.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Costs that
are specifically chargeable to the customer under the terms of the
contract may include some general administration costs and development
costs for which reimbursement is specified in the terms of the contract.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
20.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Costs that
cannot be attributed to contract activity or cannot be allocated to a
contract are excluded from the costs of a construction contract. Such
costs include:</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 58.45pt;"> (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; general
administration costs for which reimbursement is not specified in the
contract;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 58.45pt;"> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; selling costs;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 58.45pt;"> (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; research and
development costs for which reimbursement is not specified in the

<p style="margin-left: 58.45pt;"> (d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; depreciation of
idle plant and equipment that is not used on a particular contract.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
21.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contract
costs include the costs attributable to a contract for the period from
the date of securing the contract to the final completion of the
contract. However, costs that relate directly to a contract and are
incurred in securing the contract are also included as part of the
contract costs if they can be separately identified and measured
reliably and it is probable that the contract will be obtained. When
costs incurred in securing a contract are recognised as an expense in
the period in which they are incurred, they are not included in
contract costs when the contract is obtained in a subsequent period.</p>

the contract costs to complete the contract and the stage of contract
completion at the end of the reporting period can be measured reliably;
and</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 72.45pt;"> <strong>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>the
contract costs attributable to the contract can be clearly identified
and measured reliably so that actual contract costs incurred can be
compared with prior estimates.</strong></p>

the case of a cost plus contract, the outcome of a construction
contract can be estimated reliably when all the following conditions
are satisfied:</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;"> &nbsp;</p>
<p> <strong>(a) it is probable that the economic benefits associated
with the contract will flow to the entity; and</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> <strong>(b) the contract costs attributable to the contract,
whether or not specifically reimbursable, can be clearly identified and
measured reliably.</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
25.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
recognition of revenue and expenses by reference to the stage of
completion of a contract is often referred to as the percentage of
completion method. Under this method, contract revenue is matched with
the contract costs incurred in reaching the stage of completion,
resulting in the reporting of revenue, expenses and profit which can be
attributed to the proportion of work completed. This method provides
useful information on the extent of contract activity and performance
during a period.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
26.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the
percentage of completion method, contract revenue is recognised as
revenue in profit or loss in the accounting periods in which the work
is performed. Contract costs are usually recognised as an expense in
profit or loss in the accounting periods in which the work to which
they relate is performed. However, any expected excess of total
contract costs over total contract revenue for the contract is
recognised as an expense immediately in accordance with paragraph 36.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
27.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A contractor
may have incurred contract costs that relate to future activity on the
contract. Such contract costs are recognised as an asset provided it is
probable that they will be recovered. Such costs represent an amount
due from the customer and are often classified as contract work in
progress.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
28.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The outcome
of a construction contract can only be estimated reliably when it is
probable that the economic benefits associated with the contract will
flow to the entity. However, when an uncertainty arises about the
collectibility of an amount already included in contract revenue, and
already recognised in profit or loss, the uncollectible amount or the
amount in respect of which recovery has ceased to be probable is
recognised as an expense rather than as an adjustment of the amount of
contract revenue.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
29.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An entity is
generally able to make reliable estimates after it has agreed to a
contract which establishes:</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 57.45pt;"> (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; each party's
enforceable rights regarding the asset to be constructed;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 57.45pt;"> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the
consideration to be exchanged; and</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 57.45pt;"> (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the manner and
terms of settlement.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;"> It is also usually necessary for the
entity to have an effective internal financial budgeting and reporting
system. The entity reviews and, when necessary, revises the estimates
of contract revenue and contract costs as the contract progresses. The
need for such revisions does not necessarily indicate that the outcome
of the contract cannot be estimated reliably.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 34.45pt;">
30.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The stage of
completion of a contract may be determined in a variety of ways. The
entity uses the method that measures reliably the work performed.
Depending on the nature of the contract, the methods may include:</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 58.45pt;"> (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the proportion
that contract costs incurred for work performed to date bear to the
estimated total contract costs;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 58.45pt;"> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; surveys of work
performed; or</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 58.45pt;"> (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; completion of a
physical proportion of the contract work.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;"> Progress payments and advances
received from customers often do not reflect the work performed.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
31.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the
stage of completion is determined by reference to the contract costs
incurred to date, only those contract costs that reflect work performed
are included in costs incurred to date. Examples of contract costs
which are excluded are:</p>
</div>
<div>
<p style="margin-left: 62.45pt;"> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 62.45pt;"> (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
contract costs that relate to future activity on the contract, such as
costs of materials that have been delivered to a contract site or set
aside for use in a contract but not yet installed, used or applied
during contract performance, unless the materials have been made
specially for the contract; and</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 62.45pt;"> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
payments made to subcontractors in advance of work performed under the
subcontract.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;"> <strong>32.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>When
the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably:</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60.45pt;"> <strong>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>revenue
shall be recognised only to the extent of contract costs incurred that
it is probable will be recoverable; and</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60.45pt;"> <strong>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>contract
costs shall be recognised as an expense in the period in which they are
incurred.</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;"> <strong>An expected loss on the
construction contract shall be recognised as an expense immediately in
accordance with paragraph 36.</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
33.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the
early stages of a contract it is often the case that the outcome of the
contract cannot be estimated reliably. Nevertheless, it may be probable
that the entity will recover the contract costs incurred. Therefore,
contract revenue is recognised only to the extent of costs incurred
that are expected to be recoverable. As the outcome of the contract
cannot be estimated reliably, no profit is recognised. However, even
though the outcome of the contract cannot be estimated reliably, it may
be probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract
revenues. In such cases, any expected excess of total contract costs
over total contract revenue for the contract is recognised as an
expense immediately in accordance with paragraph 36.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
34.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contract
costs that are not probable of being recovered are recognised as an
expense immediately. Examples of circumstances in which the
recoverability of contract costs incurred may not be probable and in
which contract costs may need to be recognised as an expense
immediately include contracts:</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 57.45pt;"> (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that are not
fully enforceable, ie their validity is seriously in question;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 57.45pt;"> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the completion
of which is subject to the outcome of pending litigation or legislation;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 57.45pt;"> (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; relating to
properties that are likely to be condemned or expropriated;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 57.45pt;"> (d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where the
customer is unable to meet its obligations; or</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>

paragraph 22 rather than in accordance with paragraph 32.</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> <strong>Recognition of expected losses</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;"> <strong>36.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>When
it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract
revenue, the expected loss shall be recognised as an expense
immediately.</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
37.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amount of
such a loss is determined irrespective of:</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 57.45pt;"> (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whether work
has commenced on the contract;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 57.45pt;"> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the stage of
completion of contract activity; or</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 57.45pt;"> (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the amount of
profits expected to arise on other contracts which are not treated as a
single construction contract in accordance with paragraph 9.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> <strong>Changes in estimates</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
38.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
percentage of completion method is applied on a cumulative basis in
each accounting period to the current estimates of contract revenue and
contract costs. Therefore, the effect of a change in the estimate of
contract revenue or contract costs, or the effect of a change in the
estimate of the outcome of a contract, is accounted for as a change in
accounting estimate (see Ind AS 8,&nbsp;<em>Accounting Policies,
Changes in Accounting Estimates and</em>&nbsp;<em>Errors</em>). The
changed estimates are used in the determination of the amount of
revenue and expenses recognised in profit or loss in the period in
which the change is made and in subsequent periods.</p>

<p> <strong>Appendix A</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> <strong><em>Service Concession Arrangements</em></strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3.45pt;"> <em>This Appendix is an integral part
of Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS)</em></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> <strong>Background</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 37.45pt;">
1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Infrastructure for public
services-such as roads, bridges, tunnels, prisons, hospitals, airports,
water distribution facilities, energy supply and telecommunication
networks-has traditionally been constructed, operated and maintained by
the public sector and financed through public budget appropriation.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 37.45pt;">
2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In recent times, governments have introduced contractual service
arrangements to attract private sector participation in the
development, financing, operation and maintenance of such
infrastructure. The infrastructure may already exist, or may be
constructed during the period of the service arrangement. An
arrangement within the scope of this Appendix typically involves a
private sector entity (an operator) constructing the infrastructure
used to provide the public service or upgrading it (for example, by
increasing its capacity) and operating and maintaining that
infrastructure for a specified period of time. The operator is paid for
its services over the period of the arrangement. The arrangement is
governed by a contract that sets out performance standards, mechanisms
for adjusting prices, and arrangements for arbitrating disputes. Such
an arrangement is often described as a 'build-operate-transfer', a
'rehabilitate-operate-transfer' or a 'public-to-private' service
concession arrangement.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 37.45pt;">
3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A feature of these service arrangements is the public service nature of
the obligation undertaken by the operator. Public policy is for the
services related to the infrastructure to be provided to the public,
irrespective of the identity of the party that operates the services.
The service arrangement contractually obliges the operator to provide
the services to the public on behalf of the public sector entity. Other
common features are:</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 68.45pt;">
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the party that grants the
service arrangement (the grantor) is a public sector entity, including
a governmental body, or a private sector entity to which the
responsibility for the service has been devolved.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 71.45pt;">
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the operator
is responsible for at least some of the management of the
infrastructure and related services and does not merely act as an agent
on behalf of the grantor.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 71.45pt;">
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the contract
sets the initial prices to be levied by the operator and regulates
price revisions over the period of the service arrangement.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 71.45pt;">
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the operator
is obliged to hand over the infrastructure to the grantor in a
specified condition at the end of the period of the arrangement, for
little or no incremental consideration, irrespective of which party
initially financed it.</p>

This Appendix applies to public-to-private service concession
arrangements if:</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 56.25pt;"> (a)&nbsp;&nbsp; the grantor controls
or regulates what services the operator must provide with the
infrastructure, to whom it must provide them, and at what price; and</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 56.25pt;"> (b)&nbsp; the grantor
controls-through ownership, beneficial entitlement or otherwise-any
significant residual interest in the infrastructure at the end of the
term of the arrangement.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.25pt;">
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Infrastructure used in a public-to-private service concession
arrangement for its entire useful life (whole of life assets) is within
the scope of this Appendix if the conditions in paragraph 5(a) of this
Appendix are met. Paragraphs AG1-AG8 of the Application Guidance of
this Appendix provide guidance on determining whether, and to what
extent, public-to-private service concession arrangements are within
the scope of this Appendix.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 38.25pt;">
7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This Appendix applies to both:</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.25pt;"> (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
infrastructure that the operator constructs or acquires from a third
party for the purpose of the service arrangement; and</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 67.25pt;">
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; existing infrastructure
to which the grantor gives the operator access for the purpose of the
service arrangement.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 39.25pt;">
8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This Appendix does not specify the accounting for infrastructure that
was held and recognised as property, plant and equipment by the
operator before entering the service arrangement. The derecognition
requirements of Indian Accounting Standards (as set out in Ind AS 16 )
apply to such infrastructure.</p>

This Appendix sets out general principles on recognising and measuring
the obligations and related rights in service concession arrangements.
Requirements for disclosing information about service concession
arrangements are in Appendix B to this Indian Accounting Standard. The
issues addressed in this Appendix are:</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 74.25pt;">
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

rights over the infrastructure</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.25pt;">
11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Infrastructure within the scope of this Appendix shall not be
recognised as property, plant and equipment of the operator because the
contractual service arrangement does not convey the right to control
the use of the public service infrastructure to the operator. The
operator has access to operate the infrastructure to provide the public
service on behalf of the grantor in accordance with the terms specified
in the contract.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.25pt;"> <strong>Recognition and measurement
of arrangement consideration</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 39.25pt;">
12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under
the terms of contractual arrangements within the scope of this
Appendix, the operator acts as a service provider. The operator
constructs or upgrades infrastructure (construction or upgrade
services) used to provide a public service and operates and maintains
that infrastructure (operation services) for a specified period of time.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 44.25pt;"> 13
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operator shall recognise
and measure revenue in accordance with Ind AS 11 and Ind AS 18 for the
services it performs. If the operator performs more than one service
(ie construction or upgrade services and operation services) under a
single contract or arrangement, consideration received or receivable
shall be allocated by reference to the relative fair values of the
services delivered, when the amounts are separately identifiable. The
nature of the consideration determines its subsequent accounting
treatment. The subsequent accounting for consideration received as a
financial asset and as an intangible asset is detailed in paragraphs
23-26 below.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 44.25pt;"> &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.25pt;"> <strong>Construction or upgrade
services</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 44.25pt;"> 14 The operator shall account for
revenue and costs relating to construction or upgrade services in
accordance with this standard.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.25pt;"> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.25pt;"> <strong>Consideration given by the
grantor to the operator</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 44.25pt;"> 15 If the operator provides
construction or upgrade services the consideration received or
receivable by the operator shall be recognized at its fair value. The
consideration may be rights to:</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 74.25pt;">
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a
financial asset, or</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 74.25pt;">
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an
intangible asset.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p> 16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
operator shall recognise a financial asset to the extent that it has an
unconditional contractual right to receive cash or another financial
asset from or at the direction of the grantor for the construction
services; the grantor has little, if any, discretion to avoid payment,
usually because the agreement is enforceable by law. The operator has
an unconditional right to receive cash if the grantor contractually
guarantees to pay the operator (a) specified or determinable amounts or
(b) the shortfall, if any, between amounts received from users of the
public service and specified or determinable amounts, even if payment
is contingent on the operator ensuring that the infrastructure meets
specified quality or efficiency requirements.</p>
<div>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 34.45pt;">
17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The operator
shall recognise an intangible asset to the extent that it receives a
right (a licence) to charge users of the public service. A right to
charge users of the public service is not an unconditional right to
receive cash because the amounts are contingent on the extent that the
public uses the service.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 31.45pt;">
18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the operator is
paid for the construction services partly by a financial asset and
partly by an intangible asset it is necessary to account separately for
each component of the operator's consideration. The consideration
received or receivable for both components shall be recognised
initially at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 31.45pt;">
19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The nature of the
consideration given by the grantor to the operator shall be determined
by reference to the contract terms and, when it exists, relevant
contract law.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> <strong>Operation services</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The operator shall
account for revenue and costs relating to operation services in
accordance with Ind AS 18.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> <strong>Contractual obligations to restore the infrastructure to a
specified level of serviceability</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 37.45pt;">
21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
operator may have contractual obligations it must fulfil as a condition
of its licence (a) to maintain the infrastructure to a specified level
of serviceability or (b) to restore the infrastructure to a specified
condition before it is handed over to the grantor at the end of the
service arrangement. These contractual obligations to maintain or
restore infrastructure, except for any upgrade element (see paragraph
14 of this Appendix), shall be recognised and measured in accordance
with Ind AS 37, ie at the best estimate of the expenditure that would
be required to settle the present obligation at the end of the
reporting period.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> <strong>Borrowing costs incurred by the operator</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 37.45pt;">
22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
accordance with Ind AS 23, borrowing costs attributable to the
arrangement shall be recognised as an expense in the period in which
they are incurred unless the operator has a contractual right to
receive an intangible asset (a right to charge users of the public
service). In this case borrowing costs attributable to the arrangement
shall be capitalised during the construction phase of the arrangement
in accordance with that Standard.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> <strong>Financial asset</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 37.45pt;">
23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ind AS 32, Ind AS 107 and Ind AS 109 apply to the financial asset
recognised under paragraphs 16 and 18 of this Appendix.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 37.45pt;">
24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The amount due from or at the direction of the grantor is accounted for
in accordance with Ind AS 109&nbsp; at:</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 72.45pt;">
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; amortised cost;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 72.45pt;">
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fair value through
other comprehensive income; or</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 74.45pt;">
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fair value
through profit or loss.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the
amount due from the grantor is measured at amortised cost or fair value
through other comprehensive income, Ind AS 109 requires interest
calculated using the effective interest method to be recognised in
profit or loss.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> <strong>Intangible asset</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 37.45pt;">
26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ind AS 38 applies to the intangible asset recognised in accordance with
paragraphs 17 and 18 of this Appendix. Paragraphs 45-47 of Ind AS 38
provide guidance on measuring intangible assets acquired in exchange
for a non-monetary asset or assets or a combination of monetary and
non-monetary assets.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> <strong>Items provided to the operator by the grantor</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
accordance with paragraph 11, infrastructure items to which the
operator is given access by the grantor for the purposes of the service
arrangement are not recognised as property, plant and equipment of the
operator. The grantor may also provide other items to the operator that
the operator can keep or deal with as it wishes. If such assets form
part of the consideration payable by the grantor for the services, they
are not government grants as defined in Ind AS 20. They are recognised
as assets of the operator, measured at fair value on initial
recognition. The operator shall recognise a liability in respect of
unfulfilled obligations it has assumed in exchange for the assets.</p>

<div>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> This Application Guidance is an integral part of Appendix A</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> <strong>Scope&nbsp;</strong>(paragraph 5 of Appendix A)</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> AG1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paragraph 5 of Appendix A specifies
that infrastructure is within the scope of the Appendix when the
following conditions apply:</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 71pt;">
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the grantor
controls or regulates what services the operator must provide with the
infrastructure, to whom it must provide them, and at what price; and</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 71pt;">
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the
grantor controls-through ownership, beneficial entitlement or
otherwise-any significant residual interest in the infrastructure at
the end of the term of the arrangement.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 33.75pt;"> AG2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The control or
regulation referred to in condition (a) could be by contract or
otherwise (such as through a regulator), and includes circumstances in
which the grantor buys all of the output as well as those in which some
or all of the output is bought by other users. In applying this
condition, the grantor and any related parties shall be considered
together. If the grantor is a public sector entity, the public sector
as a whole, together with any regulators acting in the public interest,
shall be regarded as related to the grantor for the purposes of this
Appendix A.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 33.75pt;"> AG3&nbsp;&nbsp; For the purpose of
condition (a), the grantor does not need to have complete control of
the price: it is sufficient for&nbsp; the&nbsp; price&nbsp; to&nbsp;
be&nbsp; regulated&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; grantor,&nbsp;
contract&nbsp; or&nbsp; regulator,&nbsp; for&nbsp; example&nbsp;
by&nbsp; a&nbsp; capping&nbsp; mechanism. However, the condition shall
be applied to the substance of the agreement. Non-substantive features,
such as a cap&nbsp; that&nbsp; will&nbsp; apply only in&nbsp;
remote&nbsp; circumstances,&nbsp; shall&nbsp; be&nbsp; ignored.&nbsp;
Conversely,&nbsp; if&nbsp; for&nbsp; example,&nbsp; a&nbsp; contract
purports to give the operator freedom to set prices, but any excess
profit is returned to the grantor, the operator's return is capped and
the price element of the control test is met.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 35.75pt;"> AG4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the purpose
of condition (b), the grantor's control over any significant residual
interest should both restrict the operator's practical ability to sell
or pledge the infrastructure and give the grantor a continuing right of
use throughout the period of the arrangement. The residual interest in
the infrastructure is the estimated current value of the infrastructure
as if it were already of the age and in the condition expected at the
end of the period of the arrangement.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 35.75pt;"> AG5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Control should
be distinguished from management. If the grantor retains both the
degree of control described in paragraph 5(a) of Appendix A and any
significant residual interest in the infrastructure, the operator is
only managing the infrastructure on the grantor's behalf-even though,
in many cases, it may have wide managerial discretion.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 35.75pt;"> AG6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Conditions&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; and&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; together&nbsp;
identify&nbsp; when&nbsp; the&nbsp; infrastructure,&nbsp;
including&nbsp; any&nbsp; replacements&nbsp; required&nbsp; (see
paragraph 21 of Appendix A), is controlled by the grantor for the whole
of its economic life. For example, if the operator has to replace part
of an item of infrastructure during the period of the arrangement (eg
the top layer of a road or the roof of a building), the item of
infrastructure shall be considered as a whole. Thus condition (b) is
met for the whole of the infrastructure, including the part that is
replaced, if the grantor controls any significant residual interest in
the final replacement of that part.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2pt;"> AG7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes the use
of infrastructure is partly regulated in the manner described in
paragraph 5(a) of Appendix A and partly unregulated. However, these
arrangements take a variety of forms:</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 71pt;">
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any
infrastructure that is physically separable and capable of being
operated independently and meets the definition of a cash-generating
unit as defined in Ind AS 36 shall be analysed separately if it is used
wholly for unregulated purposes. For example, this might apply to a
private wing of a hospital, where the remainder of the hospital is used
by the grantor to treat public patients.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 71pt;">
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when
purely ancillary activities (such as a hospital shop) are unregulated,
the control tests shall be applied as if those services did not exist,
because in cases in which the grantor controls the services in the
manner described in paragraph 5 of Appendix A, the existence of
ancillary activities does not detract from the grantor's control of the
infrastructure.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 33.75pt;"> AG8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;
operator&nbsp; may&nbsp; have&nbsp; a&nbsp; right&nbsp; to&nbsp;
use&nbsp; the&nbsp; separable&nbsp; infrastructure&nbsp;
described&nbsp; in&nbsp; paragraph&nbsp; AG7&nbsp; (a),&nbsp; or&nbsp;
the facilities used to provide ancillary unregulated services described
in paragraph AG7 (b). In either case, there may in substance be a lease
from the grantor to the operator; if so, it shall be accounted for in
accordance with Ind AS 17.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 12pt;"> <strong><em>Service Concession
Arrangements</em></strong><strong>:<em>&nbsp;Disclosures</em></strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 12pt;"> <strong><em>This Appendix is an
integral part of Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS) 11.</em></strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 12pt;"> <strong>Issues</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48pt;">
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
An entity (the operator) may enter into an arrangement with another
entity (the grantor) to provide services that give the public access to
major economic and social facilities. The grantor may be a public or
private sector entity, including a governmental body. Examples of
service concession arrangements involve water treatment and supply
facilities, motorways, car parks, tunnels, bridges, airports and
telecommunication networks. Examples of arrangements that are not
service concession arrangements include an entity outsourcing the
operation of its internal services (eg employee cafeteria, building
maintenance, and accounting or information technology functions).</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48pt;">
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A service concession arrangement generally involves the grantor
conveying for the period of the concession to the operator:</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 61pt;"> (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the right to
provide services that give the public access to major economic and
social facilities, and</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 48pt;"> (b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in
some cases, the right to use specified tangible assets, intangible
assets, or financial assets, in exchange for the operator:</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<div>
<p style="margin-left: 45.45pt;"> (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;committing to provide the services according to certain terms and
conditions during the concession period, and</p>
<p style="margin-left: 9pt;"> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 45.45pt;"> (d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
when applicable, committing to return at the end of the concession
period the rights received at the beginning of the concession period
and/or acquired during the concession period.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The common characteristic of all service concession arrangements is
that the operator both receives a right and incurs an obligation to
provide public services.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The issue is what information should be disclosed in the notes in the
financial statements of an operator and a grantor.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Certain aspects and disclosures relating to some service concession
arrangements are addressed by Indian Accounting Standards (eg Ind AS 16
applies to acquisitions of items of property, plant and equipment, Ind
AS 17 applies to leases of assets, and Ind AS 38 applies to
acquisitions of intangible assets). However, a service concession
arrangement may involve executory contracts that are not addressed in
Indian Accounting Standards, unless the contracts are onerous, in which
case Ind AS 37 applies. Therefore, this Appendix addresses additional
disclosures of service concession arrangements.</p>

<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
All aspects of a service concession arrangement shall be considered in
determining the appropriate disclosures in the notes. An operator and a
grantor shall disclose the following in each period:</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 49.45pt;"> (a)a description of the arrangement;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;"> (b) significant terms of the
arrangement that may affect the amount, timing and certainty of future
cash flows (eg the period of the concession, re-pricing dates and the
basis upon which re-pricing or re-negotiation is determined);</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 49.45pt;"> (c)the nature and extent (eg
quantity, time period or amount as appropriate) of:</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 84.45pt;"> (i)&nbsp; rights to use specified
assets;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 86.45pt;"> (ii) obligations to provide or rights
to expect provision of services;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 89.45pt;"> (iii)&nbsp; obligations to acquire or
build items of property, plant and equipment;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88.45pt;"> (iv) obligations to deliver or rights
to receive specified assets at the end of the concession period;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 86.45pt;"> (v) renewal and termination options;
and</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 88.45pt;"> (vi) other rights and obligations (eg
major overhauls);</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50.45pt;"> (d) changes in the arrangement
occurring during the period; and</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 58.45pt;"> (d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how the service
arrangement has been classified.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 22.45pt;"> 6A&nbsp;&nbsp; An operator shall
disclose the amount of revenue and profits or losses recognized in the
period on exchanging construction services for a financial asset or an
intangible asset.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 14.45pt;"> 7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The disclosures
required in accordance with paragraph 6 of this Appendix shall be
provided individually for each service concession arrangement or in
aggregate for each class of service concession arrangements. A class is
a grouping of service concession arrangements involving services of a
similar nature (eg toll collections, telecommunications and water
treatment services).</p>

<p> <em>(This Indian Accounting Standard includes paragraphs set
in&nbsp;<strong>bold</strong>&nbsp;type and plain type, which have
equal authority. Paragraphs in bold type indicate the main principles.)</em></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> <strong>Objective</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;"> Income is defined in the&nbsp;<em>Framework
for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements</em>&nbsp;issued
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India as increases in
economic benefits during the accounting period in the form of inflows
or enhancements of assets or decreases of liabilities that result in
increases in equity, other than those relating to contributions from
equity participants. Income encompasses both revenue and gains. Revenue
is income that arises in the course of ordinary activities of an entity
and is referred to by a variety of different names including sales,
fees, interest, dividends and royalties. The objective of this Standard
is to prescribe the accounting treatment of revenue arising from
certain types of transactions and events.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;"> The primary issue in accounting for
revenue is determining when to recognise revenue. Revenue is recognised
when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the
entity and these benefits can be measured reliably. This Standard
identifies the circumstances in which these criteria will be met and,
therefore, revenue will be recognised. It also provides practical
guidance on the application of these criteria.</p>

The rendering of services typically involves the performance by the
entity of a contractually agreed task over an agreed period of time.
The services may be rendered within a single period or over more than
one period. Some contracts for the rendering of services are directly
related to construction contracts, for example, those for the services
of project managers and architects. Revenue arising from these
contracts is not dealt with in this Standard but is dealt with in
accordance with the requirements for construction contracts as
specified in Ind AS 11&nbsp;<em>Construction Contracts</em>.</p>

7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The
following terms are used in this Standard with the meanings specified:</strong></p>
<br>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;"> <strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Revenue&nbsp;</em></strong><strong>is the gross
inflow of economic benefits during the period arising in the course of
the ordinary activities of an entity when those inflows result in
increases in equity, other than increases relating to contributions
from equity participants.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;"> <strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fair value&nbsp;</em></strong><strong>is the price
that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date.(See Ind AS 113,&nbsp;<em>Fair Value</em>&nbsp;<em>Measurement</em>)</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;"> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Revenue includes only the gross inflows of economic benefits received
and receivable by the entity on its own account. Amounts collected on
behalf of third parties such as sales taxes, goods and services taxes
and value added taxes are not economic benefits which flow to the
entity and do not result in increases in equity. Therefore, they are
excluded from revenue. Similarly, in an agency relationship, the gross
inflows of economic benefits include amounts collected on behalf of the
principal and which do not result in increases in equity for the
entity. The amounts collected on behalf of the principal are not
revenue. Instead, revenue is the amount of commission.</p>

<p> <strong>Measurement of revenue</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Revenue
shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or
receivable.<sup>3</sup></strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
amount of revenue arising on a transaction is usually determined by
agreement between the entity and the buyer or user of the asset. It is
measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable
taking into account the amount of any trade discounts and volume
rebates allowed by the entity.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In most
cases, the consideration is in the form of cash or cash equivalents and
the amount of revenue is the amount of cash or cash equivalents
received or receivable. However, when the inflow of cash or cash
equivalents is deferred, the fair value of the consideration may be
less than the nominal amount of cash received or receivable. For
example, an entity may provide interest-free credit to the buyer or
accept a note receivable bearing a below-market interest rate from the
buyer as consideration for the sale of goods. When the arrangement
effectively constitutes a financing transaction, the fair value of the
consideration is determined by discounting all future receipts using an
imputed rate of interest. The imputed rate of interest is the more
clearly determinable of either:</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 63.45pt;">
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the prevailing rate for a
similar instrument of an issuer with a similar credit rating; or</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 63.45pt;">
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a rate of interest that
discounts the nominal amount of the instrument to the current cash
sales price of the goods or services.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;"> The difference between the fair value
and the nominal amount of the consideration is recognised as interest
revenue in accordance with Ind AS 109.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When
goods or services are exchanged or swapped for goods or services which
are of a similar nature and value, the exchange is not regarded as a
transaction which generates revenue. This is often the case with
commodities like oil or milk where suppliers exchange or swap
inventories in various locations to fulfil demand on a timely basis in
a particular location. When goods are sold or services are rendered in
exchange for dissimilar goods or services, the exchange is regarded as
a transaction which generates revenue. The revenue is measured at the
fair value of the goods or services received, adjusted by the amount of
any cash or cash equivalents transferred. When the fair value of the
goods or services received cannot be measured reliably, the revenue is
measured at the fair value of the goods or services given up, adjusted
by the amount of any cash or cash equivalents transferred.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> <strong>Identification of the transaction</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
recognition criteria in this Standard are usually applied separately to
each transaction. However, in certain circumstances, it is necessary to
apply the recognition criteria to the separately identifiable
components of a single transaction in order to reflect the substance of
the transaction. For example, when the selling price of a product
includes an identifiable amount for subsequent servicing, that amount
is deferred and recognised as revenue over the period during which the
service is performed. Conversely, the recognition criteria are applied
to two or more transactions together when they are linked in such a way
that the commercial effect cannot be understood without reference to
the series of transactions as a whole. For example, an entity may sell
goods and, at the same time, enter into a separate agreement to
repurchase the goods at a later date, thus negating the substantive
effect of the transaction; in such a case, the two transactions are
dealt with together.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> <strong>Sale of goods</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;"> <strong>14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>Revenue
from the sale of goods shall be recognised when all the following
conditions have been satisfied:</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 63.45pt;"> <strong>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>the
entity has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards
of ownership of the goods;</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 63.45pt;"> <strong>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>the
entity retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree
usually associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods
sold;</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 63.45pt;"> <strong>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>the
amount of revenue can be measured reliably;</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 63.45pt;"> <strong>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>it
is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction
will flow to the entity; and</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 63.45pt;"> <strong>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>the
costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be
measured reliably.</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
assessment of when an entity has transferred the significant risks and
rewards of ownership to the buyer requires an examination of the
circumstances of the transaction. In most cases, the transfer of the
risks and rewards of ownership coincides with the transfer of the legal
title or the passing of possession to the buyer. This is the case for
most retail sales. In other cases, the transfer of risks and rewards of
ownership occurs at a different time from the transfer of legal title
or the passing of possession.</p>
<p> <br>
<br>
<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;See also Appendix A of this standard, Revenue-Barter
Transactions Involving Advertising Services.</p>
</div>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<div>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If the entity retains significant risks of ownership, the transaction
is not a sale and revenue is not recognised. An entity may retain a
significant risk of ownership in a number of ways. Examples of
situations in which the entity may retain the significant risks and
rewards of ownership are:</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 63.45pt;"> (a)&nbsp;&nbsp; when the entity
retains an obligation for unsatisfactory performance not covered by
normal warranty provisions;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 63.45pt;"> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp; when the receipt of
the revenue from a particular sale is contingent on the derivation of
revenue by the buyer from its sale of the goods;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 63.45pt;"> (c)&nbsp;&nbsp; when the goods are
shipped subject to installation and the installation is a significant
part of the contract which has not yet been completed by the entity; and</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 63.45pt;"> (d)&nbsp;&nbsp; when the buyer has
the right to rescind the purchase for a reason specified in the sales
contract and the entity is uncertain about the probability of return.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If an
entity retains only an insignificant risk of ownership, the transaction
is a sale and revenue is recognised. For example, a seller may retain
the legal title to the goods solely to protect the collectability of
the amount due. In such a case, if the entity has transferred the
significant risks and rewards of ownership, the transaction is a sale
and revenue is recognised. Another example of an entity retaining only
an insignificant risk of ownership may be a retail sale when a refund
is offered if the customer is not satisfied. Revenue in such cases is
recognised at the time of sale provided the seller can reliably
estimate future returns and recognises a liability for returns based on
previous experience and other relevant factors.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Revenue
is recognised only when it is probable that the economic benefits
associated with the transaction will flow to the entity. In some cases,
this may not be probable until the consideration is received or until
an uncertainty is removed. For example, it may be uncertain that a
foreign governmental authority will grant permission to remit the
consideration from a sale in a foreign country. When the permission is
granted, the uncertainty is removed and revenue is recognised. However,
when an uncertainty arises about the collectability of an amount
already included in revenue, the uncollectible amount or the amount in
respect of which recovery has ceased to be probable is recognised as an
expense, rather than as an adjustment of the amount of revenue
originally recognised.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Revenue
and expenses that relate to the same transaction or other event are
recognised simultaneously; this process is commonly referred to as the
matching of revenues and expenses. Expenses, including warranties and
other costs to be incurred after the shipment of the goods can normally
be measured reliably when the other conditions for the recognition of
revenue have been satisfied. However, revenue cannot be recognised when
the expenses cannot be measured reliably; in such circumstances, any
consideration already received for the sale of the goods is recognised
as a liability.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> <strong>Rendering of services</strong><br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;"> <strong>20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>When
the outcome of a transaction involving the rendering of services can be
estimated reliably, revenue associated with the transaction shall be
recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction
at the end of the reporting period. The outcome of a transaction can be
estimated reliably when all the following conditions are satisfied:</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 63.45pt;"> <strong>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>the
amount of revenue can be measured reliably;</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 63.45pt;"> <strong>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>it
is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction
will flow to the entity;</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 63.45pt;"> <strong>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>the
stage of completion of the transaction at the end of the reporting
period can be measured reliably; and</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 63.45pt;"> <strong>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>the
costs incurred for the transaction and the costs to complete the
transaction can be measured reliably.<sup>4</sup></strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
recognition of revenue by reference to the stage of completion of a
transaction is often referred to as the percentage of completion
method. Under this method, revenue is recognised in the accounting
periods in which the services are rendered. The recognition of revenue
on this basis provides useful information on the extent of service
activity and performance during a period. Ind AS 11 also requires the
recognition of revenue on this basis. The requirements of that Standard
are generally applicable to the recognition of revenue and the
associated expenses for a transaction involving the rendering of
services.</p>

<div>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Revenue is recognised only when it is probable that the economic
benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity.
However, when an uncertainty arises about the collectability of an
amount already included in revenue, the uncollectible amount, or the
amount in respect of which recovery has ceased to be probable, is
recognised as an expense, rather than as an adjustment of the amount of
revenue originally recognised.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An
entity is generally able to make reliable estimates after it has agreed
to the following with the other parties to the transaction:</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 63.45pt;">
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; each party's enforceable rights
regarding the service to be provided and received by the parties;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 63.45pt;">
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the consideration to be
exchanged; and</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 63.45pt;">
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the manner and terms of
settlement.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;"> It is also usually necessary for the
entity to have an effective internal financial budgeting and reporting
system. The entity reviews and, when necessary, revises the estimates
of revenue as the service is performed. The need for such revisions
does not necessarily indicate that the outcome of the transaction
cannot be estimated reliably.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
stage of completion of a transaction may be determined by a variety of
methods. An entity uses the method that measures reliably the services
performed. Depending on the nature of the transaction, the methods may
include:</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 63.45pt;">
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; surveys of work performed;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 63.45pt;">
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; services performed to date as a
percentage of total services to be performed; or</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 63.45pt;">
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the proportion that costs
incurred to date bear to the estimated total costs of the transaction.
Only costs that reflect services performed to date are included in
costs incurred to date. Only costs that reflect services performed or
to be performed are included in the estimated total costs of the
transaction.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;"> Progress payments and advances
received from customers often do not reflect the services performed.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For
practical purposes, when services are performed by an indeterminate
number of acts over a specified period of time, revenue is recognised
on a straight-line basis over the specified period unless there is
evidence that some other method better represents the stage of
completion. When a specific act is much more significant than any other
acts, the recognition of revenue is postponed until the significant act
is executed.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;"> <strong>26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>When
the outcome of the transaction involving the rendering of services
cannot be estimated reliably, revenue shall be recognised only to the
extent of the expenses recognised that are recoverable.</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During
the early stages of a transaction, it is often the case that the
outcome of the transaction cannot be estimated reliably. Nevertheless,
it may be probable that the entity will recover the transaction costs
incurred. Therefore, revenue is recognised only to the extent of costs
incurred that are expected to be recoverable. As the outcome of the
transaction cannot be estimated reliably, no profit is recognised.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the
outcome of a transaction cannot be estimated reliably and it is not
probable that the costs incurred will be recovered, revenue is not
recognised and the costs incurred are recognised as an expense. When
the uncertainties that prevented the outcome of the contract being
estimated reliably no longer exist, revenue is recognised in accordance
with paragraph 20 rather than in accordance with paragraph 26.</p>

<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 63.45pt;"> <strong>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>it

Services</em></strong></p>

<strong>Issue</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
An entity (Seller) may enter into a barter transaction to provide
advertising services in exchange for receiving advertising services
from its customer (Customer). Advertisements may be displayed on the
Internet or poster sites, broadcast on the television or radio,
published in magazines or journals, or presented in another medium.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In some cases, no cash or other consideration is exchanged between the
entities. In some other cases, equal or approximately equal amounts of
cash or other consideration are also exchanged.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A Seller that provides advertising services in the course of its
ordinary activities recognises revenue under Ind AS 18 from a barter
transaction involving advertising when, amongst other criteria, the
services exchanged are dissimilar (paragraph 12 of Ind AS 18) and the
amount of revenue can be measured reliably (paragraph 20(a) of Ind AS
18.This Appendix only applies to an exchange of dissimilar advertising
services. An exchange of similar advertising services is not a
transaction that generates revenue under Ind AS 18.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The issue is under what circumstances can a Seller reliably measure
revenue at the fair value of advertising services received or provided
in a barter transaction.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Revenue from a barter transaction involving advertising cannot be
measured reliably at the fair value of advertising services received.
However, a Seller can reliably measure revenue at the fair value of the
advertising services it provides in a barter transaction, by reference
only to non-barter transactions that:</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 63.45pt;">
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; involve advertising similar to
the advertising in the barter transaction;</p>

<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Customer loyalty programmes are used by entities to provide customers
with incentives to buy their goods or services. If a customer buys
goods or services, the entity grants the customer award credits (often
described as 'points'). The customer can redeem the award credits for
awards such as free or discounted goods or services.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The programmes operate in a variety of ways. Customers may be required
to accumulate a specified minimum number or value of award credits
before they are able to redeem them. Award credits may be linked to
individual purchases or groups of purchases, or to continued custom
over a specified period. The entity may operate the customer loyalty
programme itself or participate in a programme operated by a third
party. The awards offered may include goods or services supplied by the
entity itself and/or rights to claim goods or services from a third
party.</p>

This Appendix applies to customer loyalty award credits that:</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 63.45pt;">
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an entity grants to its
customers as part of a sales transaction, ie a sale of goods, rendering

<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The issues addressed in this Appendix are:</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 63.45pt;">
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whether the entity's obligation
to provide free or discounted goods or services ('awards') in the
future should be recognised and measured by:</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 90.45pt;">
(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; allocating some of the
consideration received or receivable from the sales transaction to the
award credits and deferring the recognition of revenue (applying
paragraph 13 of Ind AS 18); or</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 90.45pt;">
(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; providing for the estimated
future costs of supplying the awards (applying paragraph 19 of Ind AS
18); and</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 63.45pt;">
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if
consideration is allocated to the award credits:</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 108.45pt;">
(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
how much should be allocated to them;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 90.45pt;">
(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when revenue should be
recognised; and</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 90.45pt;"> (iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
if a third party supplies the awards, how revenue should be measured.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> <strong>Accounting Principles</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
An entity shall apply paragraph 13 of Ind AS 18 and account for award
credits as a separately identifiable component of the sales
transaction(s) in which they are granted (the 'initial sale'). The fair
value of the consideration received or receivable in respect of the
initial sale shall be allocated between the award credits and the other
components of the sale.</p>

The consideration allocated to the award credits shall be measured by
reference to their fair value.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If the entity supplies the awards itself, it shall recognise the
consideration allocated to award credits as revenue when award credits
are redeemed and it fulfils its obligations to supply awards. The
amount of revenue recognised shall be based on the number of award
credits that have been redeemed in exchange for awards, relative to the
total number expected to be redeemed.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If a third party supplies the awards, the entity shall assess whether
it is collecting the consideration allocated to the award credits on
its own account (ie as the principal in the transaction) or on behalf
of the third party (ie as an agent for the third party).</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 63.45pt;">
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the entity is collecting the
consideration on behalf of the third party, it shall:</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 90.45pt;">
(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; measure its revenue as
the net amount retained on its own account, ie the difference between
the consideration allocated to the award credits and the amount payable
to the third party for supplying the awards; and</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 90.45pt;">
(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; recognise this net amount as
revenue when the third party becomes obliged to supply the awards and
entitled to receive consideration for doing so. These events may occur
as soon as the award credits are granted. Alternatively, if the
customer can choose to claim awards from either the entity or a third
party, these events may occur only when the customer chooses to claim
awards from the third party.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 63.45pt;">
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the entity is collecting the
consideration on its own account, it shall measure its revenue as the
gross consideration allocated to the award credits and recognise the
revenue when it fulfils its obligations in respect of the awards.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If at any time the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations to
supply the awards are expected to exceed the consideration received and
receivable for them (ie the consideration allocated to the award
credits at the time of the initial sale that has not yet been
recognised as revenue plus any further consideration receivable when
the customer redeems the award credits), the entity has onerous
contracts. A liability shall be recognised for the excess in accordance
with Ind AS 37. The need to recognise such a liability could arise if
the expected costs of supplying awards increase, for example if the
entity revises its expectations about the number of award credits that
will be redeemed.</p>

<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> This application guidance is an integral part of Appendix B.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> <strong>Measuring the fair value of award credits</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> AG1 &nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 6 of Appendix B requires the
consideration allocated to award credits to be measured by reference to
their fair value. If there is not a quoted market price for an
identical award credit, fair value must be measured using another
valuation technique.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> AG2 An entity may measure the fair value of award credits by
reference to the fair value of the awards for which they could be
redeemed. The fair value of the award credits takes into account, as
appropriate:</p>
<p> (a) the amount of the discounts or incentives that would otherwise
be offered to customers who have not earned award credits from an
initial sale;</p>
<p> (b) the proportion of award credits that are not expected to be
redeemed by customers; and</p>
<p> (c) non - performance risk.</p>
<p> If customers can choose from a range of different awards, the fair
value of the award credits reflects the fair values of the range of
available awards, weighted in proportion to the frequency with which
each award is expected to be selected.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> AG3 In some circumstances, other valuation techniques may be used.
For example, if a third party will supply the awards and the entity
pays the third party for each award credit it grants, it could measure
the fair value of the award credits by reference to the amount it pays
the third party, adding a reasonable profit margin. Judgement is
required to select and apply the valuation technique that satisfies the
requirements of paragraph 6 of Appendix B and is most appropriate in
the circumstances.</p>

<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the utilities industry, an entity may receive from its customers
items of property, plant and equipment that must be used to connect
those customers to a network and provide them with ongoing access to a
supply of commodities such as electricity, gas or water. Alternatively,
an entity may receive cash from customers for the acquisition or
construction of such items of property, plant and equipment. Typically,
customers are required to pay additional amounts for the purchase of
goods or services based on usage.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Transfers of assets from customers may also occur in industries other
than utilities. For example, an entity outsourcing its information
technology functions may transfer its existing items of property, plant
and equipment to the outsourcing provider.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In some cases, the transferor of the asset may not be the entity that
will eventually have ongoing access to the supply of goods or services
and will be the recipient of those goods or services. However, for
convenience this Appendix refers to the entity transferring the asset
as the customer.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Agreements within the scope of this Appendix are agreements in which an
entity receives from a customer an item of property, plant and
equipment that the entity must then use either to connect the customer
to a network or to provide the customer with ongoing access to a supply
of goods or services, or to do both.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This Appendix also applies to agreements in which an entity receives
cash from a customer when that amount of cash must be used only to
construct or acquire an item of property, plant and equipment and the
entity must then use the item of property, plant and equipment either
to connect the customer to a network or to provide the customer with
ongoing access to a supply of goods or services, or to do both.</p>

8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Appendix addresses the following issues:</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 63.45pt;">
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the definition of an asset
met?</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 63.45pt;">
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the definition of an asset
is met, how should the transferred item of property, plant and
equipment be measured on initial recognition?</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 63.45pt;">
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the item of property, plant
and equipment is measured at fair value on initial recognition, how
should the resulting credit be accounted for?</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 63.45pt;">
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How should the entity account
for a transfer of cash from its customer?</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> <strong>Accounting Principles</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;"> <strong>Is the definition of an
asset met?</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When an entity receives from a customer a transfer of an item of
property, plant and equipment, it shall assess whether the transferred
item meets the definition of an asset set out in the&nbsp;<em>Framework
for the Preparation and</em>&nbsp;<em>Presentation of Financial
Statements&nbsp;</em>issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants
of India. Paragraph 49(a) of the Framework states that 'an asset is a
resource controlled by the entity as a result of past events and from
which future economic benefits are expected to flow to the entity.' In
most circumstances, the entity obtains the right of ownership of the
transferred item of property, plant and equipment. However, in
determining whether an asset exists, the right of ownership is not
essential. Therefore, if the customer continues to control the
transferred item, the asset definition would not be met despite a
transfer of ownership.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An
entity that controls an asset can generally deal with that asset as it
pleases. For example, the entity can exchange that asset for other
assets, employ it to produce goods or services, charge a price for
others to use it, use it to settle liabilities, hold it, or distribute
it to owners. The entity that receives from a customer a transfer of an
item of property, plant and equipment shall consider all relevant facts
and circumstances when assessing control of the transferred item. For
example, although the entity must use the transferred item of property,
plant &nbsp;and equipment to provide one or more services to the
customer, it may have the ability to decide how the transferred item of
property, plant and equipment is operated and maintained and when it is
replaced. In this case, the entity would normally conclude that it
controls the transferred item of property, plant and equipment.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;"> <strong>How should the transferred
item of property, plant and equipment be measured on initial
recognition?</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the
entity concludes that the definition of an asset is met, it shall
recognise the transferred asset as an item of property, plant and
equipment in accordance with paragraph 7 of Ind AS 16 and measure its
cost on initial recognition at its fair value in accordance with
paragraph 24 of that Standard.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;"> &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;"> <strong>How should the credit be
accounted for?</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
following discussion assumes that the entity receiving an item of
property, plant and equipment has concluded that the transferred item
should be recognised and measured in accordance with paragraphs 9-11.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Paragraph 12 of Ind AS 18 states that 'When goods are sold or services
are rendered in exchange for dissimilar goods or services, the exchange
is regarded as a transaction which generates revenue.' According to the
terms of the agreements within the scope of this Appendix, a transfer
of an item of property, plant and equipment would be an exchange for
dissimilar goods or services. Consequently, the entity shall recognise
revenue in accordance with Ind AS 18.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;"> <strong>Identifying the separately
identifiable services</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An
entity may agree to deliver one or more services in exchange for the
transferred item of property, plant and equipment, such as connecting
the customer to a network, providing the customer with ongoing access
to a supply of goods or services, or both. In accordance with paragraph
13 of Ind AS 18, the entity shall identify the separately identifiable
services included in the agreement.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Features
that indicate that connecting the customer to a network is a separately
identifiable service include:</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 63.45pt;">
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a service connection is
delivered to the customer and represents stand-alone value for that
customer;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 63.45pt;">
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the fair value of the service
connection can be measured reliably.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A
feature that indicates that providing the customer with ongoing access
to a supply of goods or services is a separately identifiable service
is that, in the future, the customer making the transfer receives the
ongoing access, the goods or services, or both at a price lower than
would be charged without the transfer of the item of property, plant
and equipment.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Conversely, a feature that indicates that the obligation to provide the
customer with ongoing access to a supply of goods or services arises
from the terms of the entity's operating licence or other regulation
rather than from the agreement relating to the transfer of an item of
property, plant and equipment is that customers that make a transfer
pay the same price as those that do not for the ongoing access, or for
the goods or services, or for both.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;"> <strong>Revenue recognition</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If only
one service is identified, the entity shall recognise revenue when the
service is performed in accordance with paragraph 20 of Ind AS 18. If
such a service is ongoing, revenue shall be recognised in accordance
with paragraph 20 of this Appendix.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If more
than one separately identifiable service is identified, paragraph 13 of
Ind AS 18 requires the fair value of the total consideration received
or receivable for the agreement to be allocated to each service and the
recognition criteria of Ind AS 18 are then applied to each service.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If an
ongoing service is identified as part of the agreement, the period over
which revenue shall be recognised for that service is generally
determined by the terms of the agreement with the customer. If the
agreement does not specify a period, the revenue shall be recognised
over a period no longer than the useful life of the transferred asset
used to provide the ongoing service.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;"> <strong>How should the entity
account for a transfer of cash from its customer?</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36.45pt;">
21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When an
entity receives a transfer of cash from a customer, it shall assess
whether the agreement is within the scope of this Appendix in
accordance with paragraph 6. If it is, the entity shall assess whether
the constructed or acquired item of property, plant and equipment meets
the definition of an asset in accordance with paragraphs 9 and 10. If
the definition of an asset is met, the entity shall recognise the item
of property, plant and equipment at its cost in accordance with Ind AS
16 and shall recognise revenue in accordance with paragraphs 13-20 at
the amount of cash received from the customer.</p>
