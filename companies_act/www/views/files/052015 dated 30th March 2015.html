 <p style="widows: 8; font-family: Arial;" align="justify">Sir,</p>
 <p style="widows: 8; font-family: Arial;" align="justify">Stakeholders
 have sought
 clarifications as to whether amounts received by private companies
 from their members, directors or their relatives prior to 1st April,
 2014 shall be considered as deposits under the Companies Act, 2013 as
 such amounts were not treated as "deposits" under section 58A of
 the Companies Act, 1956 and rules made thereunder.</p>
 <p style="widows: 8; font-family: Arial;" align="justify">2.
 The matter
 has been examined in
 consultation with RBI and it is clarified that such amounts received
 by private companies prior to 1st April, 2014 shall not be treated as
 "deposits" under the Companies Act, 2013 and Companies (Acceptance of
 Deposits) Rules, 2014 subject to the condition that
 relevant private company shall disclose, in the notes to its
 financial statement for the financial year commencing on or after 1st
 April, 2014 the figure of such amounts and the accounting head in
 which such amounts have been shown in the financial statement.</p>
 <p style="widows: 8; font-family: Arial;" align="justify">3.
 Any
 renewal or acceptance of
 fresh deposits on or after 1st April, 2014 shall, however, be in
 accordance with the provisions of Companies Act, 2013 and rules made
 thereunder.</p>

 This
 issues with the approval
 of the competent authority.</p>
